# 507_final_project

### How to interact with the program:
#### I have created a user interface using flask, and have add links to all the main functions in the flask app homepage. User may download my project code and install required packages, and then start from flask's local homepage:http://localhost:5000/ to play around with my program.
#### The functions http://localhost:5000/ include 5 live charts build based on the cheese data, including cheese origins by country and by state(map + barchart),  pirchart of US cheese's rind distribution, a similarity cheese network based on how many common attributes cheeses share among each other, and use can also enter their favored cheeses to get most similar or different cheeses.
