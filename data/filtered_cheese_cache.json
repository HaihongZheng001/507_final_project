They used unpasteurised sheep milk available in the locality and followed a cheese-making process that dates back to 3000 years. Abbaye de Belloc is a flat wheel-shaped traditional, farmhouse, semi-hard cheese made from sheep's milk. It has a natural, crusty, brownish rind with patches of red, orange and yellow. The rind is marked with tiny craters. The cheese has a firm, dense, rich and creamy texture. The taste resembles burnt caramel, and there is a distinctive lanolin aroma. The ageing process of the cheese ranges from four to ten months. The younger wheels are made in December, while the older ones are in July. Both types of cheese wheels are sent to the market in April.",

It leaves behind a bit of bitterness on the finish. Tamie is often compared to Reblochon, but its paste is less creamy and has a stronger taste.

Since 1990, the cheese has been enjoying the prestigious AOC designation.

It has a strong smell and an intensely fruity, buttery and hazelnut flavour, with the balance of acidity and sweetness, followed by a lingering aftertaste. Unearth an aroma of nutty vegetation as you slice the cheese. However, remember the crust, including the grey layer beneath, should be removed before eating. Firm but supple and slightly grainy, the texture of the ivory-yellow pâté is creamy and velvety. Its rind is smooth with an amber colour showing canvas marks. The affinage takes at least 100 days that help release the subtle aromas. Abondance can be eaten straight off, added to salads or melted in Berthoud.

As it nears maturity, the cheese glows of a deep copper pigmentation to reveal the richness of Burgundian soils. Once the cheese is removed from the wooden box, it turns extremely creamy and velvety.

        "decription": "Gouda, or \"How-da\", as the locals say, is a Dutch cheese named after the city of Gouda in the Netherlands. If truth be told, it is one of the most popular cheeses globally, accounting for 50 to 60% of the world's cheese consumption. There are several types of Gouda, classified by age. From all of these, hard-core Gouda fans prefer to taste the aged Gouda, as they feel it takes years of maturing to bring out the complex flavours of the cheese. Aged Gouda is prepared similar to other Gouda cheeses by separating curds and whey through a heating process. As with all other cheeses, aged Gouda gets its colour by adding a colouring agent called annatto. With ageing, Gouda develops calcium lactate crystals formed by the lactic acid in the cheese. It proffers an enjoyable crunch that is unique to waxed cheeses. However, the rind of a five-year aged Gouda is unfit for human consumption. The longer a cheese is kept in maturation cellars, the more aromatic and full-flavoured it becomes. Similarly, Aged Gouda, such as a five-year aged cheese, develops a strong flavour that cheese aficionados prefer to eat alone. Accompaniments seem pale in comparison to their caramel and robust flavour. Gouda cheese goes well with beer and red wines. The taste of Vintage or Aged Gouda gets a new definition when paired with some white wines and fruity wines.",

The semi-soft cheese produced in the Burgundy region of France is coated with a thick layer of ash that gives a distinctive flavour and aroma. Also known as Cendre d'Aisy, the ash or cendre in French, gives the cheese its name. A washed-rind cheese, mostly an Époisses, is matured by covering with oak or grapevine ash. Before and after rolling it with a coat of ash, the cheese is washed in Marc de Bourgogne wine. Aisy Cendre takes a longer time to mature than normal cheeses, at least a month. As it ripens the pate softens but most cheese lovers enjoy a somewhat firm version of the produce. The aroma of Aisy Cendre is strong and the flavour is aggressive. It is a very rich & creamy cheese with 50% fat content. The centre of the cheese is salty, chalky and almost white in colour. As it moves towards the ash-covered rind, the cheese assumes a smoky flavour and smoother, creamier texture. The cheese is sold in small wheels, weighing 8 ounces each. Aisy Cendre works well with fruits like apples and pears, celery sticks. It enhances the tasting experience for fruity, full-bodied Burgundy wine, Hautes Cotes de Nuits Villages or even a full-rounded beer.",

        "decription": "Produced in the Auvergne region, Fourme d'Ambert (or simply Ambert) is one of France's oldest cheeses, dating back to the Roman occupation nearly 1,000 years ago. It is said that the Druids and the Gauls had developed the art of making this unique cheese. In 2002 it was separated from the Fourme de Montbrison, an identical cheese, to receive an individual AOC status. The cheese is a traditional, farmhouse blue cheese that can be either co-operative or artisanal. Fourme d'Ambert is more supple and dense than most blues. Milk from cows grazing on either lower or higher mountain pastures is used to produce the cheese. Although the cheese matures in 40 days, it is cave-aged for two-three months for optimum quality. During the ageing time, it is injected with Vouvray moelleux, a sweet white wine. It is easily recognizable by its unusually tall cylindrical shape. The pâté is cream coloured with prominent blue veining. The cheese is inoculated with Penicillium roqueforti spores for the growth of blue veins. Slightly tangy, savoury flavour infused by the bacteria, beautifully complements the distinct notes of butter and cream. Wine connoisseurs can enjoy the cheese with Sauternes and other dessert wines as well as full-bodied reds such as Rhone’s, Pinot Noirs and Syrah. Similar cheeses include Fourme de Montbrison, Bleu de Montbrison, Bleu de Gex and Bleu de Septmoncel. Try the cheese as a snack with bread and fruit or crumble it on salads.",

The name Anthotyros literally translated means 'flower cheese', comes from the wafting aromas of wild herbs.

When aged, it is an excellent grating cheese and can be used to augment the taste of pasta, spaghetti or salads. There's a fresh version of Anthotyros called Anthotyro Fresco (Fresh Anthotyro).",

All the milk used in the cheese production comes from pedigree Friesians that graze on their beautiful farm. The brine-washed rind glows with golden and earthy moulds. Its paste is deep yellow in colour with a slightly chalky texture and earthy aroma. The cheese emits a flash of complex flavours emphasized by acidic, buttery and savoury attributes. Tasting of Ardrahan is reminiscent of a young Gruyere. The cheese matures in four to eight weeks. A smoked variety of Ardrahan has a brownish, smoked rind with semi-soft consistency and chalky texture. Its aroma resembles smoke, peanut butter with roasted coffee notes. Ardrahan is a handmade cheese prepared using only traditional methods, whole milk and vegetarian rennet. This yellow colour cheese contains about 25% fat and is available in a large and small wheel of 1.5kg and 300g, respectively. The cheese has won many awards including the Irish Food Writers Guild annual Good Food award, British Cheese Awards and the World Cheese Awards. It pairs well with a Pinot Noir, Chianti and Sangiovese.",

There are two types of Asiago - fresh Asiago (Asiago Pressato) has a smooth texture, while aged Asiago (Asiago d'allevo) has a crumbly texture. Asiago d’allevo is matured for different time periods; Mezzano for 4-6 months, Vecchio for more than ten months and Stravecchio for two years. On the other hand, Asiago Pressato made with whole milk, is matured for a month and sold fresh as a softer, milder cheese. Depending on age, the rind of Asiago cheese can be straw-coloured and elastic to brownish-grey and hard. The paste can be white to dark yellow, with small to medium irregular holes. Based on the ageing, Asiago can be used for grating, melting, and slicing on various salads, sandwiches, soups, pasta, and sauces.",

Granted AOC status in 2003, Banon also known as Banon à la feuille is a very old, traditional cheese said to date back to the Gallo-Roman era. The cheese is wrapped in a case of chestnut leaves, held in place with raffia. Cheesemakers gather the leaves in autumn when they fall off the trees. Some producers dip the leaves and raffia in vinegar or eau-de-vie to impart a unique flavour to the cheese. Banon is aged for a minimum of two weeks. As it ages further, the soft & sticky cheese develops blue and grey moulds on and under the leaves, leading to a strong and intense flavour. The casing of leaves protects the washed-rind disc and allows the young, slightly acidic cheese to remain moist. It also imparts a fresh vegetable flavour with a hint of wine. Banon cheeses range from a firm, mild and lactic to soft, creamy and tart, with a nutty flavour. The local expertise, Fromage Fort du Mont Ventoux, is manufactured by positioning a young Banon cheese (without chestnut leaves) in an earthenware crock, seasoning it with salt and pepper and pouring over vinegar or local eau-de-vie. The crock is often placed in a cool cellar, and the cheese is left to ferment with just a sporadic stir. The longer it is left, the stronger it becomes. Banon goes well with a crusty baguette, fresh fruits and a glass of dry white wine.",

It is made between January and July using the milk of Dorset-Friesland cross sheep from the farm of Terry Perkins, located in Cornwall. Shaped into a cylinder, the cheese has a rough, crusty, natural rind which is slightly sticky with some patches of blue, gray and white moulds. It is moist, yet crumbly, with the blue appearing as bold blue-green streaks through the white interior. The flavour is steely blue, with the burnt caramel sweetness, characteristic of fine sheep's milk. It melts on the palate, disclosing its strong, spicy character. A wonderful companion to Mead, Port, Cabernet Merlot or Sweet Cider. The cheese ripens in six months and has a fat content of 45 - 50 per cent.",

The cheese is matured for 18 months, during which it develops its unique texture, colour and smell. It is often associated with its characteristic black rind. This peculiar blackened rind is achieved only when the wheels are hand coated with a mixture of clay called \"umber\" (ochre), grape seed oil and carbon black. The coating on the rind differentiates it from various Parmesan-style cheeses as well as is a tribute to the Lodi tradition. Bella Lodi is made without preservatives or added allergens, using milk that comes from cows in the Lodi area. It is white in colour, with an intense and fragrant smell; full flavour that is not too sharp or salty. The characteristics do not change much even in summer. There is a version of Bella Lodi that is produced with \"GMO-free vegetarian rennet\".",

It was formulated by Egidio Galbani in 1906 who wanted to invent a product that would compete with French Alpine cheeses. The name is derived from a book by Abbot Antonio Stoppani \"Il Bel Paese\", published in 1873. The cheese has a milky aroma infused with a mild buttery flavour. The taste can be compared with Mozzarella and St. Paulin. The pale yellow cheese may occasionally be riddled with “eyes”. The cheese is hard to spread but soft enough to slice. It is wrapped in a waxed, foil or plastic rind. Bel Paese takes 6 to 8 weeks to mature and comes in several different sizes from small buttons to large 5lb wheels. An original Bel Paese can be identified by a map of Italy and a picture of Antonio Stoppani on the label of the cheese. The American version has a map of United States on the label. The Italian cheese goes well with fruits like apples, pears and figs. As it has good melting capacity, it is often used in casseroles, hot Panini, focaccio or on a pizza. It can be eaten with fruity wines, such as dry red or white.",

The cheese is slightly salty because the milk comes from animals that graze on land near to the seashore.

It was awarded AOC status in 1975 and is available in both artisanal and industrial versions. Bleu d'Auvergne is creamy ivory-coloured cheese dotted with blue-green mould due to the Penicillium roqueforti, which gives the cheese its typical bluish-green veins. It is aged for a minimum of 4 weeks, which results in assertive flavours and a smooth texture. The rind is moist and sticky, unveiling a soft paste with a grassy, herbaceous, and spicy, peppery, salty, pungent taste.

But according to French cheese laws, the cheese came to be made exclusively from cow's milk. Bleu des Causses has a high-fat content of 45% and is matured for at least seventy days. However, the cheese can also be matured for up to six months in Causses plateau in natural limestone caves. The cheese is similar to Blue d'Auvergne in many ways, despite Bleu des Causses having a noticeably firmer, creamier texture and spicy flavours. Bleu des Causses produced in winter and summer slightly differ in texture and flavour. Cheeses made in winter are light in colour than their summer equals. The winter produce also tends to be slightly drier. A taste of the Bleu des Causses will proffer a blend of rich milkiness amidst the peppery and spicy notes of the blue mould. The summer produce brings out its unique grassy and clover flavours. It pairs excellently with sweet white wine and dessert wines such as Sauternes or Mulderbosch Late Harvest Sauvignon Blanc.",

These monks continued to make the cheese until the dissolution of their monasteries in 1540. Traditionally, sheep’s milk was used, but over the time cow’s milk was also used. The art of making the cheese was passed by the monks to the farmer’s wives who produced a blue variety of Wensleydale at their farmhouses. Today, Wensleydale is produced mainly from pasteurised cow’s milk with sheep’s milk added to enhance the flavour. Wensleydale Creamery in the town of Hawes is seeking to protect the name Yorkshire Wensleydale Cheese under PDO designation. But there are other producers of Wensleydale cheese in parts of the UK, mainly in Shropshire and Cheshire. Blue Wensleydale is a handcrafted cheese made exclusively by Wensleydale Dairy Products in the town of Hawes. It was invented by Thomas Nuttall in the late 19th century. The recipe is a variation of the famous Stilton cheese but firmer. It is matured for six months and lightly pressed for only 24 hours before being wrapped in a muslin cloth. The mellow and less salty Blue Wensleydale appeals to many newcomers and cheese connoisseurs alike.",

The cheese has a thin, bloomy rind due to a coating of light penicillin mould. Affinage of Boursault takes about two months, with one more month in packaging.

When it was first developed in Normandy, Boursin named it after his small hometown of Gournay and limited the production to Croisy-sur-Eure in France. After the acquisition of the company by Groupe Bel, production started in the United States for North American distribution. Even though Boursin is available today in more than 30 countries, it has achieved maximum popularity in France. Boursin is fresh cream and soft cheese, flavoured with herbs and spices. Although it is just an herb-flavoured French cream cheese that can be easily imitated, only Boursin with its buttery flavour and slightly crumbly texture can be labelled as an “All natural Gournay cheese”. Today, the cheese is available in various flavours whose availability varies from country to country. In most cases, Boursin is spiced up with herbs like tomato, onion, chive, fig, nuts, garlic, pepper, shallot, cranberry, fine herbs & cinnamon. A favourite member from the Boursin family is a low-fat version with only 21% fat and is flavoured with garlic & herbs. Add the original Boursin cheese to salads, pasta or serve it as a typical appetizer. It can be spread on crackers and bread or used on raw vegetables such as carrots, celery and peppers. Also, the cheese melts well to create a smooth sauce for pasta and chicken. This cheese is a favourite brand amongst top chefs.

Thompson founded the company in 1865 to support the food needs of returning Gold Rush miners. He developed a soft-ripened, fresh cheese that could be sold three days after production. He named this cheese as ‘Breakfast cheese’ and sold it in saloons where it was served on the bar as an alternative for pickled eggs. Pasteurised cow’s milk is used to prepare the cheese. After brining, for about 2 hours they are dried and sold at a very young age of 3 days. The texture of breakfast cheese is firm, slightly dense and clay-like. It is ivory white in colour. It tastes of salt and cream with a citrus tang. The pronounced flavour tastes excellent with bread and fruit and can be eaten at any time of a day as a snack.",

The cheese is made using unpasteurised milk of Lacaune sheep, native to the Massif Central region. After the cheese making process is over, the wheels are matured over fir wood boards for between 3-6 months. Brebis du Lavort Cheese is available in two sizes:A small Brebis du Lavort aged for 2-3 months is called \"Guillaume de Lavort\"A large one aged for upto 6 months is called \"Lavort\". The appearance of Brebis du Lavort is a distinctive wheel with a flattened boule on the top and bottom surfaces. Flavours are rich and subtle with characteristic notes of hay, earth, smoke and bacon. The delicate open textured pate is ivory in colour and coated with a rustic, earthy rind. Brebis du Lavort goes well with a dry white wine like Jurançon.",

The process of making Brick cheese is borrowed from white American Cheddar, although the resultant produces a slightly soft and distinctly sharper tasting cheese. Many associate Brick cheese with Germany’s surface ripened Beer cheese or Beer Käse. The name Brick is derived from the original cheese making process when artisans used Brick to press the moisture out of the cheese. An original Wisconsin Brick cheese is smear-ripened with Corynebacterium and Arthrobacter bacteria to develop a full, earthy flavour. As a Brick cheese matures, the mild and sweet flavour changes to pungent and tangy with a touch of nuttiness. The pate is smooth, open and creamy yellow covered by a washed rind on the outside. Serve Brick cheese with macaroni, potatoes au gratin, pickled vegetables or on toasted Italian bread. Young Brick cheese goes well with light red wines, Gamay Beaujolais and sweet pickles. Whilst, an aged Brick pairs with robust beers, Porter style ale and hard cider.",

        "decription": "Brie is the best known French cheese and has the nickname \"The Queen of Cheese\". Brie is a soft cheese named after the French region Brie, where it was originally created. Several hundred years ago, Brie was one of the tributes which had to be paid to the French kings. In France, Brie is very different from the cheese exported to the United States. Real French Brie is unstabilized and the flavour is complex when the surface turns slightly brown. When the cheese is still pure-white, it is not matured. If the cheese is cut before the maturing process, it will never develop properly. Exported Brie, however, is stabilized and never matures. Stabilized Brie has a much longer shelf life and is not susceptible to bacteriological infections. Brie is produced from the whole or semi-skimmed cow's milk. Rennet is added to the raw milk and heated to a temperature of 37°C (99°F) to obtain the curd.  The cheese is then cast into moulds, several layers of cheese are filled into the mould and then kept for around 18 hours. After this, the cheese is salted and aged for a minimum of four weeks. Brie cheese is slightly pale in colour with a greyish tinge under a rind. Its flavour varies depending upon the ingredients added while producing the cheese. Brie, one of the great dessert cheeses, comes as either a 1 or 2-kilogram wheel and is packed in a wooden box. In order to enjoy the taste fully, Brie must be served at room temperature. Please note: Pasteurized milk is required in the United States and Australia.",

In 1814, the European Tournament at the Congress of Vienna awarded Brie de Meaux the \"Le Roi des Fromages\" (The King of Cheeses) for its unarguable flavour and texture. Brie de Meaux, an AOC cheese, should be matured in the regions of Seine-et-Marne, Loiret, Aube, Marne, Haut-Marne, Meuse and Yonne. The difference between production and maturation places is a typical Brie tradition. This is a soft, unpasteurised cow's milk cheese covered with a bloomy rind resulting from inoculation with Penicillium Candidum moulds. As the cheese ages, the rind develops red or brown patches. When nearly half of the straw-coloured pate becomes soft, it indicates Brie de Meaux is ready for consumption. Brie has a milky and rich taste underlined by sweet and buttery flavours of mushrooms or truffles and almonds. The cheese pairs well with Champagne, a red Bordeaux or Bourgogne (Burgundy).",

It was granted an AOC protection in 1980 that requires that the cheese be manufactured under strict guidelines for supreme quality. Brie de Melun is produced from either whole or skimmed, raw milk of cows grazing in the valleys of Seine et Marne and some departments of Aube and Yonne. It is semi-soft cheese inoculated with a Penicillium mould and aged in a cellar for at least 4-5 weeks. If the cheese is left to ripen for a longer period, say several months, it matures to a Brie Noir.  It is an aromatic cheese with slightly musty and straw-like smells floating in the air. Over-ripening the Brie can result in an unpleasant odour from bacteria used to ripen the mould. The texture is semi-soft, and the rind is slightly dry. The rind turns darker and crumbly as the cheese matures to a Brie Noir. In addition, the pate is drier and darker, and the flavour is stronger to taste. The usual flavours are strongly lactic and slightly salty, finished by soft, barnyard, sour notes. Brie de Melun is used to prepare regional dishes like croûte au brie. It pairs well with Gaillac and wines from Burgundy or the Rhone Valley.",

It is named after 19th-century gastronome and epicure, Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin. It is an industrial cheese produced by three dairies situated in the Ile de France region. Since classified as triple cream cheese, Brillat-Savarin has a fat content of at least 75% achieved by adding rich, luscious cream to pasteurized cow's milk. Young cheese tastes similar to fresh cheese but usually, it is matured for about four to five weeks to develop more complex flavours. A matured Brillat-Savarin has a typical white, bloomy rind with an interior paste that is buttery-white in colour. The texture is dense, moist, and slightly chalky with enough lusciousness and creaminess. The cheese has a milky aroma with lemon sour tones. Flavours are of butter and fresh cream. Brillat-Savarin pairs well with Pale Ale and Champagne and sometimes with a Domaine Chandon Rosé or a Viognier.",

It is unpasteurised, fresh, moist yet rubbery and creamy cheese. It tastes like fresh milk, with a hint of acidity and salt. Burgos cheese was made using sheep's milk during the olden days, but nowadays, cow's milk or mixtures (raw or pasteurised) are also used to produce variations. The traditional method of its preparation required maturation for up to 10 days. But, in today's improved technologies, preparing Burgos cheese can be extended to about 30 days. Burgos is considered one of the most prestigious cheeses, which is usually accompanied by other foods like honey, quince or walnuts. The cheese pairs well with sparkling, dry white or young red wines.",

The texture is slightly thicker than clotted cream, comparable to cream cheeses such as mascarpone. Caboc has a mild, sour tang with all the all buttery creaminess and a nutty, chewy edge. It has a fat content of 67%. The recipe for Caboc dates back to the 15th century in the Scottish Highlands. It was cheese for the wealthy, as only the rich had access to rich, soft cheeses called 'White Meats'. Mariota de Ile, the daughter of the chieftain MacDonald of the Isles developed the recipe of Caboc and passed it to her daughter who in due course handed it over to the future generations.

These areas are located at the foot of the Picos de Europa Mountains in Asturias. The cheese can be made from unpasteurised cow’s milk or blended with goat and/or sheep milk. It is aged between two and four months in naturally formed limestone caves. Chilly and humid conditions in the caves facilitate the growth of bluish-green penicillium mould on this cheese. Unlike other blue cheeses injected with Penicillium, Cabrales cures from the outside of the cheese to the inward. A finished Cabrales can be characterised by its strong, penetrating aroma and sharp, acidic, slightly salty taste. It pairs well with red wine, fresh figs, salami, sweet sherry and dry sausages. The cheese is treasured as a base for sauces, melting over grilled or roasted meats. It goes well along with baguette slices, crackers, or fruit. Earlier, a traditional Cabrales was sold wrapped in moist leaves of Acer pseudoplatanus.

The history of Caciocavallo goes back to 500 BC when Hippocrates first mentioned the cleverness of the Greeks in making it. Cheeses similar to Caciocavallo are common all over the Balkans and Southern Italy. In fact, Ragusano DOP from Sicily had to drop the name Caciocavallo Ragusano to achieve the DOP label. Continuous exposure to humidity in the caves and ageing develops sharp, spicy flavours in Caciocavallo. With persistent ageing, the cheese picks up intense, earthy undertones and fruity aromas. Along the way, it turns from a milky white to a darker yellow in colour and becomes saltier. The result is a cheese with profound tasting notes and a perfect accompaniment to a glass of Primitivo red wine.",

The straw-coloured rind is smooth and waxy, while the paste is soft and homogeneous, sometimes with small \"eyes\" holes. Flavours are sweet and delicate but become stronger with prolonged ageing. The cheese is a perfect accompaniment to a glass of Primitivo red wine.",

Continuous exposure to humidity in the caves and aging develops sharp, spicy flavours in Caciocavallo. With persistent aging, the cheese picks up intense, earthy undertones and fruity aromas. Along the way, it turns from a milky white to a darker yellow in colour and becomes more salty. Few mature Caciocavallo Podolico cheeses are kept in natural caves, obtaining a cheese named Vetus.

Its texture and flavour resemble cheddar, the most popular cheese in the United Kingdom.  The recipe for Caerphilly has been inspired by other crumbly cheeses like Cheshire, young Lancashire and Wensleydale. It is said that the cheese was specially made for coal-miners as its rugged texture and shallow height made it easy for them to eat with bare hands, while the salty, moist curd helped to replenish the lost minerals. Caerphilly is made from unpasteurised cow's milk and matured anywhere from 8 to 10 to 14 days. Some variants are often kept for up to a year to develop a more rigid texture and more robust taste. Inside the pale ivory rind of the cheese, young Caerphilly has a fresh and pleasant taste alongside a moist yet supple texture. With maturity, the edges become creamy, and the flavour becomes more rounded. It usually has a wheel shape with ivory-white rind dusted with refined flour. As the cheese ages in a moist cellar, the white and grey moulds become thicker and more leathery. The cheese can be vegetarian, depending upon the brand. A basic white burgundy would go well with this cheese. It usually is grated or melted onto dishes.",

However, the production of Camembert cheese has now transcended the AOC designation. Good varieties of Camembert cheese made from pasteurised milk can be found in Normandy today. The best of them is the Camembert Le Châtelain. The fresh Camembert cheese is bland, hard and crumbly in texture. Young Camembert has a milky and sweet taste. As the cheese matures, it forms a smooth, runny interior and rich, buttery flavour. The white bloomy rind is because of a white fungus.

Today, however, a few producers make cheese from raw milk with Hagel's method and they can legally call their cheese Camembert de Normandie under the AOC guidelines. Today, good varieties of Camembert cheese made from pasteurised milk can be found in Normandy today. The best of them is Camembert Le Châtelain. The fresh Camembert cheese is bland, hard and crumbly in texture when fresh. As the cheese matures, it forms a smooth, runny interior and a white bloomy rind that is typical of Camembert cheese. It has a rich, buttery flavour. The rind is bloomy white, caused by a white fungus called penicillium candidum. It is meant to be eaten with cheese. This cheese is best paired with a light red wine such as Beaujolais, Chenin Blanc, St Emilion, St Estephe or traditionally a glass of Normandy cider.",

        "decription": "Although, Cheddar is originally a product of England, now, Canada produces some of the best cheddar in the world. The climate, soil, pasture, cattle stock, and milk quality separate out superior Canadian Cheddar from the regulars. Unlike other cheddars, Canadian cheddars have a smoother, creamier texture as well proffer the right balance of flavour and sharpness. Depending on their age, the flavour, texture and aroma of cheddar cheese can vary. Cheddar is traditionally creamy white in colour but due to the addition of tasteless food colouring, it often appears dyed in an orange hue. The cheese can be made from raw, pasteurised or thermalized milk to retain more of the flavour-enhancing enzymes. Even if cow’s milk is the most commonly used source for making the cheese, it is not uncommon to find Canadian cheddar made from sheep or goat's milk. Cheddar ripens from inside out and is classified depending on its ageing time. In Canada, cheddar is produced almost entirely by a number of large companies in Ontario including limited artisanal producers. Of these, the most prize-winning cheddar maker in Canada is the Balderson Cheese Company. The cheese is aged for a minimum of three months and maximum up to six years for optimal supreme quality. Flavoured cheddar cheese spiced up with some popular flavours, made in Canada includes cranberry, dill, flax, garlic, jalapeno, olive and sun-dried tomato. Some of the common types of Canadian Cheddars are Lancashire, Double Gloucester, Wensleydale, Leicester, Derby, Cheshire, Cantal, Caerphilly and Colby. Mild Cheddar, Medium Cheddar and Marble Cheddar are ideal for snacking and with lighter foods like omelettes, sandwiches and as a garnish. Old Cheddar can be used for shredding, slicing and pairs well with white wines and pale ales/lager. Extra Old Cheddar compliments white wines, red wines & rose wines. It is best used for rich, creamy sauces, shredding, baking.",

Cantal jeune -  a young cheese aged 30 to 60 days, during which it develops a thin grey-ivory crust and a smooth, pale yellow, close-textured paste. It is fresh, sweet, milky in flavour with a light hint of hazelnut and vanilla. Cantal entre-deux - a cheese aged between 3 to 9 months, has the flavours of green pastures and aromas of butter and cream. After three months of ripening, Cantal cheese starts to come into its own. The cheese is additionally grouped as \"fremier\" and \"laitier\", wherein fermier is a farmhouse cheese made of raw milk while laitier is the commercial, mass-produced version from pasteurised milk. Cantal works well with nuts, grapes, and apples and can be used in salads, soups, cheese fondue, or gratins. Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot are a few wines that pair nicely with Cantal.",

Only the youngest, freshest milk is used to enable clean and fresh tastes in the finished cheese. Capra Nouveau is a mountain style cheese with a cider washed rind. This results in a complex, rich antique-rose rind on the outside complemented by an ivory soft, sweet, creamy body within.The cheese is a fascinating blend of fruity aroma from the rindwashing in cider balanced by the nutty and herbaceous flavours of the paste. It tastes beautiful with a glass of fragrant Gewurztraminer, red Burgundy or an artisan cider. This celebrated cheese has won many international awards including Super gold at the 2014 World Cheese Awards. It has been judged as one of the world's 62 best cheeses.",

Apart from its flavour, it is noted to be a very healthy cheese containing a good amount of vitamins and antioxidants. It is also low in cholesterol. The cheese should be stored at a temperature of between 4° and 8°C and consumed at room temperature. Casciotta d'Urbino is usually served with traditional dishes such as mountain bread, meats, ham and beans. But it can also be used in spreads and sauces.

The rennet used in making this cheese makes it suitable for vegetarians. Depending on the age, Cashel Blue's texture varies from chalky to soft yellow paste. Young cheese tastes & smells chalky and lactic, while the older ones are rich & buttery with a well-formed blue colour. Over 18 weeks of maturing, the cheese takes on a robust flavour and granular texture. It is one of the finest blue cheeses that relies on its balance in taste, texture and aroma. Young Cashel Blue pairs well with Gewurztraminer, while medium-aged wheels favour Sauternes and New World Botrytis Semillion. The aged cheeses are good with LBV Port.

It is named after a Roman soldier who, despite being persecuted, kept on preaching gospels and gave its name to the famous sanctuary town of Castelmagno in Grana Valley. The cylindrical-shaped cheese is made from cow's milk with a small addition of sheep and/or goat's milk. The milk utilized must come from communes protected by PDO designation to guarantee the product's authenticity. The ageing takes two to five months to get the characteristic traditional flavour.  It is a dense cheese with no open holes tending towards a grainier, crumbly texture. The pate colour leans from ivory white towards ochre-yellow with the presence of bluish-green veins of penicillium moulds. Covering the pate is a thin reddish-yellow rind, which turns wrinkly, and brownish-ochre as the cheese matures. The subtle taste of Castelmagno gets stronger, spicier and sharper as it ages. Barolo, Reciota della Valpolicella, Chianti pair well with this cheese. It is appreciated as a table cheese and used to prepare typical Italian dishes such as gnocchi.",

It is either round or half-cylinder shape with a rind that is engraved with the mark left by the wooden mould. The greyish-dark brown colour of the rind conceals a yellow coloured pate. This cheese comes from the Spanish region of Castile-Leon, which accounts for 85% production of pure sheep's milk cheese. Castigliano best represents the cheese-producing region. The ripening process of Castigliano lasts at least two months to develop a medium mature and mature age cheese. It comes in pieces ranging between a kilo and 3.5kg. The cheese is similar to Manchego but comparatively, it is quite moist and has a few rice-sized holes. Cheeses made with raw milk such as Castigliano have a spicy, cream-caramel, buttery flavour that is perfectly offset by the fresh acidity and hint of salt. The fruity tang of the table cheese when served with the classic Spanish quince or membrilla, takes the dish to a completely new level. Nowadays, a recent variety of cheese produced with a mixture of cows, ewes and goat’s milk has a somewhat mild flavour. Castigliano cheese goes well with good regional red wines.",

It is a soft-white cheese of round shape with ash-grey, natural rind. Made from cow's milk, this cheese is very similar to Olivet au Foin and Olivet au Poivre, but is cured for at least one month in wood ash from vines. The slow curing process gives the cheese a rather pungent, spicy aroma. The cheese, made in cylinders, has a grey skin from the ash and ivory-white supple and chalky dough. It has an earthy scent of the mould with a delicate taste. The best period for the production of the cheese is May and June.",

Here, in this case, Chabichou du Poitou is manufactured in a small area in the Poitou, Berry and Perigord regions of France. Made with unpasteurized and whole goat’s milk, the cheese won Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée (AOC) in 1990 guaranteeing the authenticity of the produce. The cheese is produced only by a few farmsteads or cheese retailers, and it is sold locally. The cheese comes in the shape of a truncated cylinder called \"bonde\", approximately 6 cm in height and 5 to 6 cm in diameter. It is matured for a minimum of 10 days, but generally for 2 to 3 weeks or even more for vigorous flavour. Upon ageing, Chabichou develops a characteristic, edible wrinkled rind dotted with occasional grey patches. After cutting, the cheese reveals a firm, creamy “bright white” interior. Even though it smells typically “goaty”, the flavours are sweet with a bit of a salty and tangy. Balance the flavours of the cheese with Chenin blanc, Cidre or wheat beer.    ",

The cheese is sprinkled with pepper, herbs or ash for that extra kick in texture and flavour.

Dense and crumbly, Cheshire is made using vegetarian rennet and pasteurised cow’s milk. The taste and flavour of cheese develop with ripening. Young Cheshire is firm, crumbly and white in colour. It is mild, milky and aromatic leaving behind a slightly tangy aftertaste on the palette. Sometimes, to add a different dimension to the cheese, annatto is added to the milk, which gives Red Cheshire a deep shade of red-orange. However, there is no difference in the flavour and texture in both cousins. Another variant is a Blue Cheshire ripened with Penicillium culture moulds. An aged Cheshire becomes firmer and darkens considerably. It is now a full-flavoured cheese yet with no hint of bitterness. Though still crumbly, the cheese turns dry with maturity. Cheshire with its lower salt content makes for a perfect crumble on fruits, chutney, and vegetable and baked dishes.",

After Chevrotin was awarded the Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée (AOC) in 2002, the cheese came to be produced exclusively in the Haute Savoie region of France. The cheese should be a mix of the raw milk of one herd of goats. Produced only a farmstead, milk should come from a herd containing 80% Alpine breed goats. To guarantee the authenticity of the produce and AOC stamp, the diameter of each cheese cylinder must measure 9 to 12cm and a length of 3 to 4.5cm. It should contain 45% fat and weigh between 250 to 350 grams. Chevrotin des Aravis is a washed rind cheese made similar to a Reblochon, except with goat’s milk. The maturation which lasts for 3-4 weeks results in a fine and smooth paste and a yellowish-orange rind that is moist and tainted with moulds. As with other chevre cheese, it has the odor of goats and flowers with a nearly sweet taste. Being a mountain cheese, it has an inherited aromatic sourness suggestive of wild herbs fed to the goats. Chevrotin des Aravis pairs well with Cotes du Rhone, Bandol, Mondeuse, Chignin-bergeron, Saint-joseph and Savoie wines.",

There are two main varieties of Chhurpi; the soft variety prepared out of cow's milk and the hard variety prepared out of yak's milk. Chhurpi is made by separating whey from buttermilk solids to produce curds similar to Italian Ricotta. Fresh curds are white, soft and neutral to taste but they are left to ferment to acquire a bit of tanginess. Soft Durkha or Chhurpi is an excellent source of protein and used as a substitute for vegetables in the mountainous region. A curry and/or pickle are made of Chhurpi and is eaten with rice as a staple food in everyday meals. Chhur singba or Chhur mingba is freshly prepared Chhurpi prepared by adding the extract of crab apple fruits (thung). Hard Durkha or Chhurpi is made out of yak milk. After the curds are cured at room temperature for 2-3 days, the cheese is sliced and left to dry in the sun or dried in the oven on low heat. This type of Chhurpi becomes very hard and lasts many years. If hard Chhurpi is as old as 4 to 5 years, it is called chhurpupu. If stored properly in yak skin (mongnang), hard Chhurpi can be consumed even for 20 years.",

The ash collected from bonfires is used to coat the young pecorina cheese that adds a flavour of herbs and myrtle. This traditional method of preserving the cheese allows it to develop the rind as well nutty, grassy notes. The cheese is matured in containers placed in underground trenches called Hallows and aged between 3-6 months.",

It is compared with cheddar cheese since both are dyed to appear orange, even though they taste radically different. Due to the US dairy regulations, Colby cheese is made from cow's milk and is available at grocery stores all over the US. The cheese was developed in 1874 by Joseph Steinwand at his cheese factory near Colby, Wisconsin. Though Colby cheese looks similar to cheddar due to its colour, Colby cheese is softer, milder, creamy and has a more open texture. It does not undergo the 'cheddaring' process but is manufactured with a washed curd process that reduces the acid content. An aged Colby becomes cracked and dry, so it is advisable to eat when young.  Colby's gentle flavour and texture give a new definition to grilled sandwiches, hamburgers, fajitas, rye bread or apples and pears. It is sometimes blended with other cheeses, such as Monterey Jack, to make Colby Jack cheese.",

A few times, Comté gets its name from the cellar where it has ripened such as Comté Fort Saint-Antoine. Comté was one of the first few kinds of cheese to receive an AOC (Appellation d'origine controlee) status in 1958. It is one of the most popular AOC cheeses in France with around 40,000 tonnes of annual production. Considered one of the finest cheeses in the world, a wedge of Comte reveals a pale yellow interior and a texture that can vary from silky, flabby to crystalline. There are practically 83 flavours, which can be savoured while tasting Comté. But the main aromatic flavours that delicately linger on the palate are a balance of brown-butter and roasted-nut aromas and a sweet finish. Its ability to melt easily means Comté goes well with many recipes right from fondues to Croque Monsieur. The cheese pairs well with Rhone reds, a Palo Cortado or off-dry Amontillado sherry from Spain. Fromageries Arnaud, the winner of Super Gold medal at the 2014 World Cheese Awards, is one of the top-notch groups in the world to make French certified-origin cheeses. Today, the Fromagerie counts for roughly 12% of the total Comté production. The cheese is distributed worldwide by British supplier Anthony Rowcliffe & Son. This celebrated cheese has been judged as one of the world's 62 best cheeses.In addition, Comte produced by Entremont also won a silver medal for its great taste and impeccable texture. Entremont makes Comte in three varieties – 1 year matured Prestige, fruity flavoured Fruité and Vieille Reserve made using traditional methods in 50 small village cheese dairies.",

Named after its doughnut shape, \"La Couronne\" literally translates as \"the crown\" and Lochoise is the area where the cheese originated. This ash coated cheese is produced in limited quantities by a small number of artisanal cheese makers.The texture of Couronne Lochoise is soft and creamy with a delicately thin rind. The bone white interior of the cheese has the texture and taste of buttered pastry. The cheese is mildly acidic and somewhat salty with a mild \"goatiness\" typical of goat cheeses. The aromas remind you of fresh, green grass of the rich pasture lands of the Touraine. If allowed to mature, its doughnut form allows the cheese to mature in inside and out. Accompany the cheese with wines from the Loire such as a white Sancerre or reds such as Anjou or Bourgueil.",

Made from cow's milk, 16 liters of immaculated fresh milk from the selected area are required to produce just one kilo of this amazing cheese. Protected with DOP law, it becomes an extraordinary by its content of vitamins and proteins and also by its calcium and phosphorus rich nature. After the maturation period of natural ageing, its paste offers an extraordinary healthful power with soft and velveteen nature. This cheese is known as \"new\" when it has passed the current year, said to be \"mature\" when it has completed a period of 12 - 18 months. It is called as \"old\" when it reaches a period of 18 - 24 months and \"ultra old\" when it is aged for 24 - 36 months. The quality of each and every cheese is examined by eight factors namely age, maturing degree, fragrance, structure, paste colour, consistency, rind condition and dappling. The shape of cheese is checked by the \"threshing\" and \"dowelling\" processes with the help of specific tools such as the percussion hammer, the screw needle, the plug or probe. The colour of cheese goes from golden straw to pale straw, equally spread over the cheese shape. This typical cheese goes well with Champagne or with the best Italian red wines such as Brunello and Barolo.  Two varieties of Cravero Parmigiano Reggiano: Cravero Parmigiano Reggiano San Pietro - A cheese produced by San Pietro is aged for a year at their farm, then transferred to Cravero family for further aging. Fully aged cheese is deep-savoury, brothy-flavoured with bass notes. Cravero Parmigiano Reggiano Baruffi - A cheese produced by Baruffi is aged for a year at their farm, then transferred to Cravero family for further aging. Fully aged cheese is creamy, smooth with sweet, fruity, aromatic flavour and mouthwatering high notes.",

Given that it is made from a combination cream and milk, the cheese has a high fat content. In the US, cream cheese need to contain at least 33% fat content while in Britain it should be a minimum of 45-65%. Anything above is considered double or triple cream cheese. In German, it is also called Doppelrhamstufel meaning cheese made with \"double cream\". The cheese has a mildly lactic aroma and a slightly salty taste. Cream cheese is firmed with the use of lactic acid and so needs to be consumed fresh. It has a relatively short life even when refrigerated. Cream cheeses made using traditional methods tend to be more crumbly than spreadable while those with stabilizers like guar gum are more firm. The taste, texture and production are similar to Boursin and Mascarpone. Cream cheese is suitable for vegetarians since it uses acid, such as citric acid to coagulate the milk. Cream cheese has a mild, sweet taste with a pleasant slight tang. It is a smooth, spreadable cheese at room temperature and comes in various flavoured varieties including those with herbs, fruits blended in. The cheese is widely consumed in United States where it used to enrich cheesecakes, frostings, dips, toppings, sweet & savory dishes and desserts. It is also used to make flavourful desserts with colourful fruit combinations such as blueberries, raspeberries and kiwis.",

Cropwell Bishop Blue Stilton produced by Cropwell Bishop Creamery Limited is traditional Stilton handmade from cow's milk using methods that have changed very little since the 17th century. Both traditional and Organic Blue Stilton are created using vegetarian rennet, meaning both are suitable for vegetarians.The rich and creamy stilton is typically rubbed with salt mid-process and aged for 12 weeks to mature. This cultivates a rich and tangy cheese with a unique, strong flavour developed by the blue mould spores added to the milk. It offers a melt in the mouthfeel and velvety soft texture. The cheese is crumbly yet firm and has a dry brown wrinkled rind around a creamy ivory paste with blue veins that spread all the way to the edges.This genuine classic tastes delicious with fresh, crusty bread, with any sweet chutney or jam, honey, pears and walnuts, regular cracker or biscuit. Try pairing the cheese with drinks such as Pudding wine, Port, Dry sherry, Claret for a great combination.This celebrated cheese has won many medals at the Nantwich International Cheese Show and a Silver medal at the 2014 World Cheese Awards. ",

At this stage of the maturing process, it has a creamy, nutty taste. After about six weeks, while its smell starts getting more robust, its pate becomes dry and brittle. Moreover, a more rigid texture with a pronounced flavour starts to develop. Hereafter, the cheese continues to mature, and the robust taste increases but never gets sour.

The elasticity and firmness of the cheese allow for easy cutting. It has small, round eyes about 10mm in diameter that may be less prominent in variants where flavourings are used. The smell of Danbo is mild, slightly acidic, and aromatic due to smear ripening. Its unique taste and texture are achieved after maturing for about 3-4 weeks. The fat percent in Danbo varies from 15 to 45%.  It is a rectangular cheese with a smooth, dry rind, and sometimes it is covered in red wax. Flavourings such as caraway seeds add a new dimension to the taste of Danbo. When caraway seeds are added to the cheese, it is known as \"King Christian\" cheese, named after King Christian IX, who ruled Denmark during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.",

It is sometimes compared to mild cheddar because of the texture, but Derby is milder with a buttery, creamy flavour and strong melting ability. Only a few farms in England make Derby cheese the time-honoured way. Traditional Derby matured for nine months has an open texture with a smooth, creamy body and a nutty flavour. Due to its melting characteristics, it is used in many dishes. It goes well with fresh fruits and Chenin Blanc or Sauvignon Blanc.  ",

It is aged for a minimum of two weeks, finally reaching its optimum maturation at six to eight weeks.A coveted medal winner at the 2013 American Cheese Society competition, Dirt Lover pairs perfectly with IPAs, Pale Ales, and Lambic.

The cheese, made from the milk of once nearly extinct Old Gloucester cows, traces its origins to 1498 in the City of Gloucester. Gloucester comes in both single and double varieties. While Single Gloucester is made from skimmed milk, Double Gloucester uses full fat milk. In addition, Double Gloucester is twice the height of Single Gloucester and more flavourful. It is also said that Double Gloucester uses the whole milk taken from two milking or a mixture of milk and cream. The double variety has a smooth and buttery texture, rich and nutty yet mellow flavour and apricot colour thanks to the addition of annatto plant extract. Vegetarian rennet is used and the cheese is aged for at least 4 months. If the cheese is allowed to age further, it will develop more complex and nutty flavours. Moreover, the texture tends to become very hard and flaky. Double Gloucester participates every year in the Cooper's Hill Cheese-Rolling and Wake where buyers jump on the cheese to evaluate its quality and sustainability. A traditional British Ale or red like Syrah will perfectly complement a Double Gloucester. Double Gloucester A has won many international awards including Silver medal at 2014 World Cheese Awards.",

This uncooked, pressed cheese is washed with saltwater brine and matured at least two to six months in cool and damp cellars. After four months, the washed rind thickens and becomes yellowish while the paste is soft yet firm. It has the characteristic strong smell of sheep's cheeses with a pronounced fruity and nutty flavour. The best Esbareich is found during summer and autumn.

It requires the cheese to be pressed but not cooked and slowly matured for a period of three to six months. Etorki has a rusty, bumpy rind because of the molds formed during pressing.

These monks continued to make the cheese until the dissolution of their monasteries in 1540. Traditionally, sheep’s milk was used, but over the time cow’s milk was also used. The art of making the cheese was passed by the monks to the farmer’s wives who produced a blue variety of Wensleydale at their farmhouses. Today, Wensleydale is produced mainly from pasteurised cow’s milk with sheep’s milk added to enhance the flavour. Wensleydale Creamery in the town of Hawes is seeking to protect the name Yorkshire Wensleydale Cheese under PDO designation. But there are other producers of Wenslydale cheese in parts of the UK, mainly in Shropshire and Cheshire. Extra Mature Wensleydale, matured for nine months is the strongest Wensleydale produced by Wensleydale Creamery. It is placed on shelves in the atmospherically - controlled maturing room. Wensleydale goes well with fruit cake, apple and is a perfect accompaniment during lunchtime or tea time. It also tastes delicious with hot desserts like fruit pies and crumbles.

The other versions are much milder than the original Fontina. There is also a Danish version which can be recognised by the red wax rind. Italian Fontina has a natural rind that turns orange-brown with ageing. Fontina Val d'Aosta is traditionally made from unpasteurised cow's milk. The texture and flavour of the cheese depending on how long it has aged. The texture can vary from semi-soft to firm, and the flavours can go from mild and rich to more robust and overpowering. Usually, Fontina is aged for 90 days. The interior of Fontina is pale cream and riddled with holes known as \"eyes\". With a fat content of 45%, the cheese is very rich and creamy, which gets nuttier with ageing. This versatile cheese is used to make fondues and similar Italian dishes.

It is available in different forms and varieties, the foremost being fresh mozzarella or mozzarella fresco. It is a type of mozzarella that is just been made and ready to be consumed at room temperature. Fresh mozzarella balls are sold in a brine, whey or water solution to help them retain their moisture and shape. This cheese has a soft, moist texture and is full of milky flavour. Similar to other fresh cheeses, mozzarella fresco is high in water content and therefore low in fat. It has a slightly acidic or lactic taste. Compared to mass-processed mozzarellas, the freshly made variant is creamier and much softer. True buffalo mozzarella is highly appreciated around the world than the one made with cow’s milk. Fresh mozzarella’s firmer texture has gained popularity as a slicing cheese on pizzas or flatbreads, snacks, salads or vegetables. It pairs well with fresh tomatoes, pestos, fruits, olives, basil and tapenades. Try the cheese with cava or other sparkling wines. This cheese is available in curd form to pull your own fresh mozzarella by hand, logs or shape of balls called Bocconcini. These days fresh mozzarella is available in most supermarkets and Italian stores. Let the cheese soak in the brine solution until ready to consume and eat it within 2-3 days. Consuming fresh is recommended as it becomes bitter and sour with age.",

The full-bodied cheese is rich in flavour with a soft paste and a moist, creamy, yet almost flaky, texture. It is covered by a velvety grey mould coating that lends it a woody aroma. The flavour is reminiscent of damp earth underlined by slightly nutty & herbal essences. Its milky, delicate taste is not at all typical of a goat’s cheese.

The cheese, made from the milk of once nearly extinct Old Gloucester cows, traces its origins to 1498 in the City of Gloucester.Gloucester comes in two varieties. Single Gloucester is made from skimmed milk and Double Gloucester uses full-fat milk. In addition, Double Gloucester is twice the height of Single Gloucester and more flavourful. It is also said that Double Gloucester uses whole milk taken from two milkings or a mixture of milk and cream. On the other hand, Single Gloucester uses whole cream milk from the morning milking and skimmed milk from the evening milking. Single Gloucester has a P.D.O designation, meaning it is produced only in Gloucestershire. It is matured for less time and thus develops a fresh, somewhat nutty taste but is slightly more acidic than Double. Also, it is lighter in texture, crumbly and low in fat.Double Gloucester has a smooth buttery texture, rich and nutty yet mellow flavour and apricot colour due to the addition of annatto plant extract. Vegetarian rennet is used, and the cheese is aged for at least four months. The cheese develops more complex and nutty flavours if it is aged further. Moreover, the texture tends to become very hard and flaky. Double Gloucester participates every year in Cooper's Hill Cheese-Rolling and Wake, where buyers jump on the cheese to evaluate its quality and sustainability. A traditional British Ale or red like Syrah perfectly complements a Double Gloucester.",

If truth be told, it is one of the most popular cheeses in the world, accounting for 50 to 60% of the world's cheese consumption. It is a semi-hard cheese celebrated for its rich, unique flavour and smooth texture. The original cheese markets in Gouda is one of the last standing commercial cheese markets in the Netherlands. Since the name is not protected, it has become a generic classification for all cheeses produced and sold under the name Gouda. Gouda is typically made from pasteurised cow’s milk although some artisan varieties use sheep’s or goat’s milk to produce cheeses that are going to be aged for a long time. Boerenkaas is a typical variety of unpasteurised Gouda cheese produced by the farmers from the milk of cow's grazing on the natural, low pastures of Netherlands. There are seven different types of Gouda cheese, categorized depending on age. Graskaas is young Gouda ready to be consumed within weeks of production. On the other hand, is the extra aged, Overjarig cheese which has a full-flavoured, hard, golden interior and salty flavour reminiscent of toffee. Between the spectrums is a variety of Dutch Gouda’s classified as per the texture and age - Jong, Jong belegen, Belegen, Extra belegen, and Oud. Each cheese gets increasingly firmer in texture and richer in flavour than earlier classification. The waxed rind of the cheese also changes by the age as soft, younger Dutch Gouda cheese are identified by yellow, orange, or red wax rinds white mature cheese have black wax coverings. Stacked Gouda WheelsIn America, smoother and less flavourful commercial Gouda is popular than Dutch Gouda. Artisans in the Netherlands may produce Dutch Gouda using raw milk as well as pasteurised.  To enhance the flavour of the cheese, herbs, seasonings, and nuts may be blended. In the Netherlands, aged Gouda is commonly used to richen soups, sauces. Young Goudas are best paired with beer while medium cheeses taste best when paired with a fruity Riesling or Chenin Blanc. A well-aged Gouda complements wines that are deeply flavoured such as a rich Merlot or Shiraz. Gouda cheese may be grated, sliced, cubed or melted. It may be used as a table cheese or dessert cheese. Gouda is available in large wheels with each weighing between 10 and 25 pounds.",

Grand Vatel is also known as Boursault and Délice de Saint-Cyr. The cheese invented in 1953 by Henri Boursault has a very high fat content which lends it a melt-in-the-mouth, creamy soft consistency. With fat percent tipping the scales at nearly 75%, the ultra rich buttery taste and very creamy texture of Grand Vatel makes it a favorite dessert cheese. The cheese has a thin, bloomy rind due to a coating of light penicillin mold. Aging of Grand Vatel takes about two months with one more month in packaging. As the cheese ages, it acquires a mushroomy and a refreshing citrusy taste. The cheese sold in small cylinder shaped rounds should be consumed within a week of purchase. Try pairing this cheese with grapes or pears and light, fruity wines like Vouvray.",

Its texture is similar to that of mozzarella or thick feta, except that it has a strong, salty flavour imbibed from the brine preserve. Cooking the Halloumi removes all its saltiness and empowers it with a creamy texture. Since the cheese has a high melting point, it can be easily fried or grilled. Its unusualness lies in the preparation of the cheese where no acid or acid-producing bacterium is required. Halloumi is generally served during the warmer months with watermelon, due to its refreshing qualities. It is an essential part of a Cyprus Meze and many a times it is offered as an accompaniment with cold beer. The cheese also tastes lovely when grilled, pan-fried or thinly sliced on a salad.",

Crafted to perfection, using traditional techniques, this variation is marvellously smooth and nutty in flavour with a robust aroma. A pure vegetarian cheese made from pasteurised cow's milk, it is matured for at least nine months or sometimes longer to achieve the correct texture consistency. When young, the texture of this cheese ranges from moist to smooth transcending to concentrated and flaky when well aged. Because of its firm texture, it is often compared to a French Beaufort. The cheese has a fat content of 45%. The cheese is available in truckle shaped barrel of 30 kgs. It is one of Australia’s most awarded cheeses and has won Grand Champion Cheese at the 2002 Australian Grand Dairy Awards. Because it melts well and has a great texture, Heidi Cheese is ideal for cooking, grilling or using in a fondue, soufflé or quiche. A ripe and crisp wine such as Chardonnay will pair well.",

It is usually shaped into a brick when sold. The flavour is mature and the degree of ripeness weakens towards the centre. When young, Herve is sweet and becomes spicy as it ages.

It is a mould-ripened cheese with a distinguishing layer of edible ash. The cheese ripens from the outside to the centre, resulting in a fresh goat cheese centre surrounded by a pungent runny shell. This runny shell will widen as the cheese matures and is considered the best part of the cheese by many. The bloomy mould and ash rind is edible but relatively tasteless. The cheese is creamy, light, powdery, slightly lemony and mildly goaty. Humboldt Fog is available from a mini 1 lbs. cheese wheel (Humboldt Fog® Mini) up to the large 5 lbs. cheese wheel (Humboldt Fog® Grande). The cheese won first place at the American Cheese Society in 1998, 2002, 2005 and 2019. Along with many other awards, it won Gold International Cheese and Dairy Awards in 2019 and 2021.",

Named after the village of Idiazabal, the cheese received Spanish D.O. (Denominacion de Origen) in 1987.In summer, the sheep migrate to higher pastures to graze on the blossoming, new grass. During this time, the artisanal cheese makers milk the sheep, make the cheese and leave it in the rafters to mature for a minimum of two months. Matured Idiazabal has a hard natural rind, a compact texture, with a few pinprick holes. The rind carries the marks of the wooden moulds in which it was drained. The characteristic, smoky flavour is the result of the cheeses having been stored near the fireplaces. The taste of the cheese is reminiscent of burnt caramel and bacon. The pairs well with red wine and cider.PDO Idiazabal smoked cheese won a Super Gold medal at the 2014 World Cheese Awards. It is declared one of the world's 62 best cheeses. ",

Beneath the yellow-wax rind of Jarlsberg is a semi-firm yellow interior that is buttery, rich in texture with a mild, nutty flavour. It is an all-purpose cheese, good for cooking as well as eating as a snack. Jarlsberg tastes delicious on sandwiches, fondues, quiches and on hot dishes. The versatility of the cheese is appreciated well beyond the Scandinavian world in the US, UK and Europe. Jarlsberg is available in wheels, slices, wedges, minis, and random weight pieces.   ",

Kanter is the Dutch word for 'edge', referring to the angular shape of the cheese, with a sharp transition from the side to the bottom of the cheese. Kanterkaas is available in two varieties: Kanterkomijnekaas, flavoured with cumin, and Kanternagelkaas, laced with cumin and cloves. It is a hard cheese made with two types of fats: 20+ (20-25%) and 40+ (40-44%). The colour of the rind is natural or may be treated with a colourless, yellow-coloured, or red-coloured cheese rind coating agent. The flavour of Kanterkaas changes as it ages. Plain Kanterkaas is nice and spicy to tangy, depending on age. Kanterkomijnekaas tastes fragrant, spicy, pleasant and mild to intense. Kanternagelkaas flavour varies from fragrant, spicy, warm and spicy to tangy. The pate of the cheese is firm to hard. The colour of Kanter cheese is evenly ivory or yellow to yellow-green. It has a closed body, but some holes may exist. The cloves and cumin are evenly spread throughout the pate.",

Kashkaval Preslav is the name given to the cheese made from a mixture of ewe's and cow's milk. In Romania, Bulgaria, and Macedonia, Kashkaval used as a generic term for all kinds of yellow cheeses. This cheese is also found in Hungary, Croatia, and Turkey. The Romanians call this cheese Cascaval, the Greeks Kasseri, while the Turkish prefer to interpret it as Ksara. The cheese is allowed to age for six months, during which it develops a piquant, spicy and somewhat salty taste with a slight hint of olive oil. Due to its similarity in taste with the United Kingdom's Cheddar cheese, it is famously called the \"Cheddar cheese of the Balkans\".

Affinage takes at least four months and the temperature of affinage and conservation must be below 140C.Laguiole has a thick, greyish-orange and natural rind beneath which lies a straw-coloured supple and firm pate.

However, locals also produce versions of cheese from cow’s and goat’s milk. One such cheese made from unpasteurised ewe’s milk is semi-cooked and pressed, sculpted in the shape of flattened round loaf. It is packaged in a cylinder weighing 5 to 6 kilograms and measuring 30 cm in diameter and 9 cm thick. The crust of this cheese is smooth, straw coloured while the paste is supple dough. At 6 months of ripening, the texture of the cheese becomes hard and brittle. When young, the cheese has a sweet, smoky, mild and nutty taste which becomes pronounced and intense with age. The affinage of six months gives the cheese a balanced blend of acidity, salt and fat. It is used as a table cheese, but when aged, it is also good for cooking.",

Since the name is protected in Spain, an authentic Queso de La Serena is recognizable by the fire branding on the top lid.The cheese is made from raw full cream milk and vegetable rennet obtained from pistils of artichoke thistle. After maturing for at least 60 days, it develops a waxy yellow rind and the imprints of esparto grass in which it is moulded. The flavour graph varies according to its age, ranging from buttery when it is young and bitter when it is mature. During maturing, the cheese turns into a deliciously runny and almost liquidy paste. A fully matured La Serena has a creamy consistency that can be scooped out after cutting out the circular lid. The intense bitter yet pleasant flavour tastes best with bread or toast. ",

This Dutch cheese is produced in factories and traditionally on farms in the historic area of Leiden (Leyden).The addition of cumin seeds gives the cheese a distinctive dry, tangy and spicy flavour, very unlike other Dutch cheeses. Cloves and Caraway seeds are also added occasionally for that extra boost. The wax-coated Leyden is a perfect addition to any cheese platter. Pairing it with an ice-cold beer or a Shiraz and dark malty bread will do wonders.",

Artisanal cheese makers prepare this cheese from pasteurised cow’s milk sourced from local, organic farms. As a result, the flavour of the cheese is mild despite the stinky aroma. The exterior of the cheese is covered with a thin pale, orange-brown rind, an effect of regular washings. In the first month, Limburger is firm and crumbly and becomes chalky and soft at the end of six weeks. After two months, the cheese is much smoother and creamy. After three months, Limburger acquires the infamous aroma due to smear-ripening bacterium. This cheese has a significant grassy and mushroomy taste underlined by a delicate tang at the end. Limburger goes well with Belgian style ales and icy cold bock beer. It tastes best when it is served between two slices of dark rye bread and a slice of onion.",

It is made in a similar way to traditional West Country Cheddar using unpasteurised cow’s milk. The cheese was invented by Simon Jones from Lincolnshire, who decided to turn the spring milk from his herd of Holsteins into cheese. Traditional Lincolnshire Poacher is available in a cylindrical shape, coated by a rind appearing similar to granite. It is a slow-maturing cheese that takes between 12-24 months to develop a golden, straw-coloured yellow pate and spotted brown and grey colour rind. One gets daily, and seasonal variation in terms of both flavour and texture but all-in-all the cheese has both cheddar and gruyere-like qualities. It has a smooth texture and a strong taste. In summer, notes of pineapple, toasted nuts and grassy dominate the flavour profile while in winter, the taste becomes savoury and almost meaty. Lincolnshire Poacher pairs well with full-bodied reds and whites and beer. The company makes many other traditional kinds of cheese such as Vintage Lincolnshire Poacher aged for 18 to 22 months, Smoked Lincolnshire Poacher, Double Barrel, and Lincolnshire Red, made using vegetarian rennet.",

The taste is nutty, melting in the mouth to release the flavours of a salty lemon and spiciness. The texture is creamy, smooth and quite runny at room temperature. Each wheel is washed in brine, coloured in annatto and matured for up to two months in warm, humid cellars to develop the delicious taste.Livarot is best enjoyed with a full-bodied red wine, a glass of Calvados, Normandy cider or even a traditional French hard cider. It tastes excellent with crusty bread and fruits or added to vegetables, fruit salads, soups and gratins.",

The aging process takes six to eight months during which the cheeses are rubbed and turned every other day to create a light grey rind. Underneath is a golden yellow paste that deepens as it gets closer to the rind. The texture is dry and a bit grainy with flavour of roasted hazelnuts and salty caramel, along with fresh grassy notes. Lord of the Hundred's sweet and savory flavour pairs very good with medium-bodied Pinot-Noir or Cream Ale as a beer selection. This cheese can be used as a substitute to Parmigiano-Reggiano.

Depending on the season, the cheese can also be made from cow’s milk or a combination of goat's and cow's milk. The full fat cheese, which gained AOC certification in 2005, is shaped to resemble a truncated cone. It is soft, cream coloured, firm, creamy and smooth with a melt-in-the-mouth consistency. As it ripens, marks of blue penicillium may start to envelop the cheese, turning it from ivory to bluish. Mâconnais gives away a light herbal, salty flavour and smell. The longer the maturation process, the harder and saltier, Mâconnais will become. The cheese perfectly goes with a glass of Chablis, Macon Red or a Beaujolais, Wheat beer, crackers and fruit.",

The flavours are sweet, fresh and mild with an edge of saltiness and sweetness. A tasting of Mamirolle leaves behind an almost buttery texture in the mouth.

The farmhouse version is produced from unpasteurized milk, while the industrial version is produced from pasteurized milk.

A typical ear wheat pattern is pressed onto the top and bottom wheels of the cheese. Manchego cheese is available in wide varieties. Fresco: Fresh cheese aged for two weeks. The flavour is rich, mild and is rarely available outside Spain. Semi Curado: Semi-firm cheese aged around three weeks to three months. It is supple and moist with a fruity flavour and tangy notes. Curado: Semi-firm cheese aged for 3-6 months. The flavour is caramel and nutty. Viejo: Firm cheese aged for 1-2 years. The flavour is sharp with a crumbly texture.

Also known as Marolles, the cheese gets its name from the village of Maroilles where it is still produced. It is also said that the cheese has been created in the 10th century by a monk, Maroilles in northern France. While preparing Maroilles, the industrialized version uses pasteurised milk as opposed to the artisan cheese which is still depends on raw milk. It usually has a square shape with brick-red, smooth, washed and sticky rind. When young, the cheese is called “Maroille Blanc” because the cheese has still not developed the distinctive brick red rind and characteristic flavour. It is matured from five weeks to four months during which it is regularly washed with salt and water. If eaten young, the cheese is still chalky in the center and has a bitter rind. As it ages and with the washing process, the rind changes its colour from yellow to orange and finally red. At four months, the ivory pâte is soft and oily. It has a powerful, pungent aroma suggestive of fermenting fruit and the flavour reminds of smoky bacon. Earthy notes of walnuts and mushrooms contrasted by a strong, pungent aroma are very typical of an aged Maroilles. This cheese is produced in various sizes and the content of fat is about 29 per cent.",

It is a thick, double or triple cream soft cheese with a very high-fat content ranging from 60% to 75%. The resulting rich butterfat content makes the cheese an essential ingredient in Italian recipes like Tiramisu and cheesecakes. The texture of Mascarpone ranges from smooth, creamy to buttery, depending on how it is processed during cheesemaking. The concise portrayal of Mascarpone really is just thickened cream that is on its way to becoming butter. Making cheese is so simple that many people easily make Mascarpone at home. Mascarpone is used in both sweet and savoury dishes. It is added to enhance the flavour of the dish without overwhelming the original taste. The cheese tastes best with anchovies, mustard and spices or mixed with cocoa or coffee. Tiramisu, a layered dish with espresso, brandy, chocolate, and Mascarpone has brought cheese to the forefront of Italian cooking. Another possible use of Mascarpone is to thicken puddings and dessert creams. It is also popular as a standalone dessert served with fruit or syrup. Whether you buy Mascarpone or make it at home, it needs to be consumed within a few days, or it can go bad. ",

These monks continued to make the cheese until the dissolution of their monasteries in 1540. Traditionally, sheep’s milk was used, but over the time cow’s milk was also used. The art of making the cheese was passed by the monks to the farmer’s wives who produced a blue variety of Wensleydale at their farmhouses. Today, Wensleydale is produced mainly from pasteurised cow’s milk with sheep’s milk added to enhance the flavour. Wensleydale Creamery in the town of Hawes is seeking to protect the name Yorkshire Wensleydale Cheese under PDO designation. But there are other producers of Wenslydale cheese in parts of the UK, mainly in Shropshire and Cheshire. Mature Wensleydale is a harder, flavoured variant of Wensleydale produced by Wensleydale Creamery. Wensleydale goes well with fruit cake, apple and is a perfect accompaniment during lunchtime or tea time. It also tastes delicious with hot desserts like fruit pies and crumbles. It is the king of cheeseboard where its fresh, milky sweetness and robust flavours rule the roost. It complements fruity white wine such as Pinot Grigio.",

It was originally a monastery cheese but today it is produced only in a specific region of Italy following age-old traditional methods. Montasio Vecchio aged over 12 months is dry and granular with bold, sharp taste. The paste is much crumblier and the characteristically “small” eyes are likely to disappear. Its straw yellow pate colour pate turns yellowish while the pale brown rind becomes hard with aging. The flavour is now pleasantly sharp, working excellently on pasta or rustic soups.

It is named after the town of Mothe-Saint-Héray, where the cheese has been made and sold since the 19th century. In 2002, the cheese was awarded an AOC designation to protect the quality standards. Fresh goat’s milk is used to prepare the cheese, and it matured in a room with unusually high humidity. It is covered in a protective chestnut, sycamore or plane leaf coating during the maturity period. Mothais a la Feuille has a soft, runny texture that becomes dense as it ages. The unique combination of earthy, lemony and mould flavours of the leaf become intense as the cheese matures. On the surface, the rind of the cheese is delicate and wrinkled with blue and green mould underneath the leaf shell. It has been injected with a strain of Geotrichum that allows the cheese to breathe and develop the typical goat milk flavour. Mothais a la Feuille pairs well with Champagne or a single-malt whisky.",

It can be kept in brine for up to a week. Low-moisture mozzarella can be refrigerated for a month; some shredded low-moisture mozzarella's shelf life is up to six months.  Since 1996, mozzarella is recognised as a Traditional Specialty Guaranteed (TSG/STG) food product in the EU. It is available in the form of balls of different sizes. Fresh mozzarella is one of those easy-to-make-at-home cheeses used in salads, meats, seafood, and vegetables. Mozzarella di Bufala, also known as 'buffalo mozzarella', is made from domesticated water buffalo milk. Mozzarella Fior di Latte is produced from fresh, pasteurised or unpasteurised cow milk, while low-moisture mozzarella is made from whole or partly skimmed milk. And last, but not least, mozzarella affumicata is a smoked variety of mozzarella. Ciliegine is a traditional Italian type of mozzarella made with pasteurized cow's milk or sometimes with water buffalo's milk, and is available in small smooth white balls. Mozzarella made from sheep's milk by adding lamb rennet, is called mozzarella pecorella or mozzapecora, in Sardinia, Abruzzo, and Lazio. Mozzarella is also produced from goat's milk.",

        "decription": "Munster, also known as Munster Géromé is a soft washed rind cheese made from milk produced by cows living in the regions between Alsace, Lorraine and Franche-Comté in France. The name Munster is derived from the little town of Munster where Vosgian abbeys and monasteries used to make this cheese since the Middle Ages. Traditional Munster is protected by an Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée (AOC) which requires the cheese be made from unpasteurised cow's milk called crude milk. The soft and creamy cheese also comes flavoured with cumin and tastes best when accompanied with a good beer. As with washed rind cheeses, Munster have a red coating on the rind that is slightly humid due to repeated washings. Other than protecting the cheese, the rind is also responsible for a strong, penetrating aroma and tangy taste. The best Munster cheeses are produced in the summer and autumn when the cows graze on the 'high stubble' of the Vosges. This cheese has a very high fat content of 45-50%. Gewurztraminer or full-bodied red wines nicely complement Munster. If you're a potato and cheese lover try Munster with potatoes, salad and finely chopped onions.",

Legend goes that French farm girls fell in love with English soldiers during the Hundred Years War and started making heart shaped cheeses to show their love. Granted AOC status in 1969, Neufchatel can be industrial, farmstead or artisanal. Artisanal Neufchatel has a grainy, close textured and thick paste covered with a soft, downy, velvety bloomy rind.

The cheese is surface-ripened for more than 6 weeks during which it develops flavours of fresh mushrooms, nuts and milk and a very slightly acidic aroma. As the cheese ripens, these flavours intensify and become more robust.  When young, Noyan is not too strong and can be used to add flavour to many types of sauces.

        "decription": "Wensleydale is an historic fresh, mild cheese that has been made in Wensleydale, North Yorkshire since 1150 by Cistercian monks. These monks continued to make the cheese until the dissolution of their monasteries in 1540. Traditionally, sheep’s milk was used, but over the time cow’s milk was also used. The art of making the cheese was passed by the monks to the farmer’s wives who produced a blue variety of Wensleydale at their farmhouses. Today, Wensleydale is produced mainly from pasteurised cow’s milk with sheep’s milk added to enhance the flavour. Wensleydale Creamery in the town of Hawes is seeking to protect the name Yorkshire Wensleydale Cheese under PDO designation. But there are other producers of Wenslydale cheese in parts of the UK, mainly in Shropshire and Cheshire. Oak Smoked Wensleydale is naturally smoked for 18 hours using oak chips at the Wensleydale Creamery dairy to generate a subtle, smoked flavour along with a firmer and stronger texture. The cheese is a variant of Real Yorkshire Wensleydale as it maintains the same characteristics while adopting an attractive golden beech colour. Wensleydale goes well with fruit cake, apple and is a perfect accompaniment during lunchtime or tea time. It also tastes delicious with hot desserts like fruit pies and crumbles. It is the king of cheeseboard where its fresh, milky sweetness and robust flavours rule the roost. It complements fruity white wine such as Pinot Grigio.",

This cheese unites two regions of France in the Western Pyrénées: Ossau valley of Bearn and Iraty Forest of Basque Country. It received an AOC protection in 1980, which requires that the cheese be produced with the milk of only two breeds of ewes - Manech and Basco-Béarnaise. An uncooked and pressed cheese, Ossau-Iraty is semi-hard in texture with a thick, buff rind marked with rust and grey moulds. Beneath the brown and orange rind is an ivory white, supple and slightly grainy interior that has a creamy and buttery mouth feel. Flavours are herbaceous, nutty and fruity if the produce is from winter while the summer cheeses tend to reveal aromas of grass and flowers. Matured for at least 6 months, Ossau-Iraty often comes in a flat cylindrical shape. There are three main sizes available, small (Petit-Ossau-Iraty-Brebis Pyrenes), intermediate (non-fermier) and large (fermier). It is sometimes dusted with paprika leaves to add a kick of flavour. It tastes delicious with fruity red, full-bodied red or white wines such as Zinfandel, Tempranillo or Syrah.",

The six main Pecorino kinds of cheese have received Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) status under European Union law. All these varieties differ from each other, depending on their ageing period. As per legislation, production of Pecorino Romano is allowed only on the islands of Sardinia, Lazio and in the Tuscan Province of Grosseto. Pecorino Sardo (from Sardinia) and Pecorino Toscano (from Tuscany) are not that salty.  As the name suggests, the history of Pecorino Romano dates back to Roman times when it was a part of the staple diet of soldiers at war. Roman authors, including Varro, Pliny the Elder, Hippocrates and Columella, have mentioned cheese & its production techniques. Even today, cheese is made using the traditional method. The wheels get salted numerous times by hand to deliver a fabulous taste. After ageing for more than five months,  it develops a dry and granular texture and a strong taste. When young, the cheese has a soft and rubbery texture with a sweet and aromatic flavour. The flavour becomes sharper and smokier when aged for more than eight months. Pecorino Romano is one of the most widely used, sharper alternatives to Parmesan cheese. Pecorino Romano is an excellent grating cheese over pasta dishes, bread and baking casseroles. Pair it with a big, bold Italian red wine or a light beer. Romano cheese is a milder cheese made from cow's milk in the United States.",

Made from cow’s milk, it is enriched with cream so that it contains at least 40% fat content. The 30g version of the cheese is called Petit-Suisse, while larger packagings are referred to as a double Suisse, double petit-Suisse or Suisse double. Petit-Suisse has a mixture of sweet and sour flavours and tastes delicious with jam, fruit, honey and nuts. It is sometimes salted and peppered with herbs.

Since 1983, it has been protected by Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée (AOC) status, which requires the cheese to be made only in the area extending from the Canton of Bariac in the Gard to Valreas in Vaucluse. The name, Picodon, comes from an old French dialect and means \"to sting\".The cheese made with raw goat's milk has a hard natural rind covered in mould that can be pale ivory to soft white or pale blue-grey. Pate is smooth, firm and homogeneous, which becomes crumbly as it matures. It has a pungent goaty smell and tastes slightly sour and sweet. The flavours become more pronounced with maturity. This cheese can be packed with herbs in local green olive oil jars. Picodon cheeses are very similar to Pelardon cheeses of the Languedoc region.Picodon is enjoyed best after a meal with red or dry white wines or rosé Côtes du Rhône. It can be mixed with salad and garlic or shallots.",

Since leaf wrapping is no more allowed these days, it comes wrapped in leaf printed aluminium foil. Queso di Valdeon has been awarded a status of Protected Geographical Indication (PGI) for regulating the production, processing and preparation of the cheese. In 2005, the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food granted the cheese an award for best Blue Veined Spanish Cheese. It also got a Silver Award at the World Cheese Awards in 2015. The pate of Valdeon has a soft, granular texture and pale yellow colour and is full of small cavities filled with blue moulds. Covered by a coarse, inconsistent rind in dark grey shades with tiny red marks, Valdeon is very strong and spicy in taste similar to Roquefort. The rich smell of the cheese makes a good company with fresh fruits and red wine or sherry.  ",

The other, Provolone Piccante, is aged for more than four months and has a sharper taste. In South America, a similar cheese called Provoleta is eaten with grilled meat. In America, Provolone produced is similar to the Dolce variety. The flavours of Provolone broadly vary depending on where it’s made. Mostly, it’s semi-hard in texture and made from cow’s milk. Provolone contains high amounts of calcium and protein, but on the other hand, it is also high in sodium. The cheese goes along with full-bodied and aged red wines.

Provolone del Monaco is a semi-hard, kneaded-curd, matured cheese produced from the raw milk of cows reared within the province of Naples. For the product to maintain the consistent quality, it follows specific procedures and criteria. Twenty percent of the milk comes from Agerolese cows to give Provolone del Monaco its unique flavour. The cheese should be matured for a minimum of 180 days; at the end, the product should weigh 2.5 kg but not more than 8 kg. The pear-shaped body of the Provolone tied with raffia is cream coloured, elastic, compact and has characteristic eye holes which may increase towards the centre of the cheese. It has a high-fat content of 40.5%. Thanks to the stringent guidelines and intricate processing, the cheese turns out to be extremely flavourful, with a sweet, buttery aroma with a light, pleasantly spicy taste. With an extended maturation period, the taste and aroma of the cheese become more robust and spicier. The ripe flavour of the cheese goes along with full-bodied and aged red wines. It could be served with hot chutneys, homemade bread, and flat-bread at the table.",

        "decription": "Provolone is an Italian cheese made from cow's milk and whose origins lie in Southern Italy. Though many countries have started producing this cheese, traditional Provolone is still produced only in the northern region of Italy. Both Provolone ValPadana and Provolone del Monaco are granted DOP designation by the European Union to ensure that cheese is produced under strict supervision using specific methods to guarantee supreme quality. Provolone Valpadana is produced in the plains from Milan to Udine. Provolone del Monaco cheese is made in the areas around Naples.  The technique of spinning the curds to produce pasta filata cheeses like Provolone, Scamorza cheese and mozzarella has its origins in the Middle Ages. Provolone ValPadana, a DOP protected cheese variant, is made from the whole milk of cows grazing in the plains from Milan to Udine. Animal rennet is used to produce Provolone ValPadana, which is then moulded into various traditional shapes and matured depending on the weight of the cheese. The cheese has a sweet, delicate flavour that becomes spicier and more pronounced throughout curing. There are two types of Provolone available. Provolone Dolce is aged 2-3 months and has a pale yellow to white colour with a sweet taste. The other, Provolone Piccante, is aged for more than four months and has a sharper taste. Either version may be smoked, specified as 'Affumicata'. Provolone Dolce goes well with young and fruity wines such as Novello, Barbera and Valcalepio. Provolone Piccante makes a good pairing with aged and structured wines, like Amarone, Valpolicella, Refosco, and Barbaresco. It can be eaten as is or together with Cremona mustard or honey, or breaded and fried or grilled.",

It is soft, white, chalky with a crumbly, slightly lumpy texture that softens as the cheese ripens. The colour of the pate is white to pale straw, which changes upon ripening. The thin and soft rind is pinkish white when young, turns to reddish grey-green after maturation. Quartirolo Lombardo is ripened between 5 to 30 days for soft PDO Quartirolo Lombardo and more than 30 days for Ripe PDO Quartirolo Lombardo. The taste is distinctive, slightly sour and aromatic in the fresh cheeses, which intensifies as the cheese ages. The delicate and fragrant flavour of the younger cheese becomes stronger and typically aromatic upon ripening.Quartirolo Lombardo is a typical table cheese that goes well with salads, cold dishes, fruits, walnuts and honey.

It is one of the oldest cheeses in Sicily, with evidence dating as early as 1500. Initially known by the name of Caciocavallo, it lost its historical name after acquiring the recognition of PDO. A hard cheese from the pasta filata family, Ragusano is made with whole milk from the Modicana breed of cows fed on fresh grass or hay. When milk from other cow breeds is used, due to the scarcity of the Modicana breed, the cheese is called “Cosacavaddu Rausanu”. The cheese is sold at different stages of ageing in rectangular blocks. When it is fresh within two months of production, the cheese tastes sweet, pleasant and delicate. Cheeses ripened beyond six months tend to become more flavourful and spicier. The rind is smooth and thin and exhibits a yellowish-golden colour that deepens as the cheese ages. Ragusano, smoked using natural processes, is also available, and here, the designation stamp will have the word “affumicato” attached to the name of the cheese. A compact cheese with straw-coloured pate, Ragusano goes well with full-bodied red wines and aged dark beers.",

The cheese was decreed as an AOC cheese in 1958 and therefore is subject to follow strict rules and regulations. It is a lightly pressed, uncooked cheese made from full-cream unpasteurised milk. Thirteenth-century fables tell of Savoie herdsmen who carried out an incomplete milking of the cows to reduce their 'taxable' production of milk. After the rent was paid to the landowners, they went back to 'remilk' (reblocher) the cows. The second milking of cows yielded milk that was rich in fat, and was used to make Reblochon. Reblochon features a fine, velvety rind, varying from yellow to orange. The close textured pate is very smooth, supple and ivory in colour. Farmhouse cheese discs are matured for at least two weeks, during which the cheese develops an edible light beige crust and buttery dough. Reblochon has a slight scent of the cellar and a mild fruity taste with an intense nutty aftertaste. Its delicate and subtle flavours go well with a glass of Savoie wine. The cheese is excellent on the cheeseboard. Reblochon also features as a classic ingredient in one of the Alps' best-loved dishes, the Tartiflette.",

The history of cheese dates back to the 17th century when farmers recognized the need to make and look at their cheeses apart from cheese made in other parts of the country. They decided that the colour of the cheese should denote its richness and creaminess. To set it apart from cheddar and highlight the quality of cheese, Leicester is coloured with a vegetable dye called annatto. The rind is reddish-orange with a powdery mould on it. The colour indicates that the milk used has a high cream content. Today, only a couple of farms in Leicestershire make the cheese using the traditional method and raw milk. Red Leicester is a hard cheese, similar to cheddar but much moister, crumblier with a milder flavour. It matures faster than cheddar and can be sold as young as two months. A good Leicester cheese can be identified by a firm body and a close, flaky texture. Though the cheese can be consumed young, to reach its optimum flavour, it should be allowed to mature for six to nine months. A good cheese tastes slightly sweet with an almost caramel flavour and builds up a more robust taste as it ages. The cheese suits a full-bodied white wine such as Muscadet, SancerreChenin Blanc and Vouvray.",

Tomme du Haut-Richelieu, simply called as Richelieu, is a Canadian cheese made by cheesemaker Fritz Kaiser in the late 90s. The cheese shares an interesting invention story which had the fromagerie in two minds over the extra goat milk they received to make its soft cheese Chevrochon. So Kaiser decided to use the additional goat milk to make a firmer cheese that would have a longer shelf life and a good ageing possibility. Thus was born Tomme du Haut-Richelieu, a firm cheese which has a pale orange, smooth washed rind covered in a thin, white mould. Inside the paste turns a soft beige at the wheel edge, lightening as it centres towards the middle. The aroma is hay like with a nutty and milky flavour. It has a typical yet subtle goaty tang and a melt-in-the-mouth taste that intensifies as the cheese ages. ",

In the 1930s, the farmers had to dilute goat's milk with cow's to produce the cheese due to the scarcity of goatherds. But, today, they produce this rare cheese from goat's milk. Rigotte can be eaten fresh, but the actual flavours develop on maturity. The pate becomes slightly moist, and the rind becomes nearly dry and finely wrinkled after maturation. The nutty, delicate flavour of honey and acacia will leave a wonderful taste in the mouth. It goes with Condrieu, red wines like Cornas and maybe a white St. Joseph.",

It is a washed rind cheese, strong and spicy like Maroilles, with a light yellow rind. The cheese is characterized by a distinct, salty flavour with a lingering bitterness. Its yeasty, slightly fruity aroma reminds us of Romadur. Its rough, sticky red smeared rind reveals a firm, but tender, interior. Rollot is usually produced in disc or heart-shaped form. The maturation takes around 2–7 months, depending on size and fat content. This cheese tastes delicious with a glass of white wine.",

It is aged for about 5 months, which makes it a very strong flavoured cheese comparable to a Limburger. The third version is made from pasteurised milk with added cream. Tilsit displays a brownish-orange washed rind with a springy elastic semi-firm texture that is ideal for slicing. It is moist and creamy with spicy undertones. This cheese has a piquant flavour which makes it a perfect table cheese. It can be used in salads, added to sauces or melted over baked dishes. There are various producers around the world who make Tilsit under their brand’s name. This includes the one made on Heidi farms in Tasmania, Australia, called 'Heidi Tilsit'. Though the cheese was called Royalp Tilsit or Tilsiter in Switzerland during the olden days, it is now simply called Tilsiter or Tilsit.

The French call this cheese a Caille doux.Affinage for the cheese takes around 2-6 weeks during which it develops a bloomy rind and a natural golden-beige colour. The taste, rind and texture are creamy, delicate and soft due to the use of soft curd in the cheesemaking process. In fact, the cheese is sometimes sold in a small ceramic or terra cotta pot since the pate can almost become runny. The optimal flavour of this creamy, buttery and nutty cheese occurs between April and September. Cheese aficionados adore Saint Félicien with a chilled Sancerre or Pouilly Fume.

It is a full-fat cheese containing 45% of fat. Sbrinz AOP is a 100% natural cheese since it is made from first-class raw milk, rennet and salt without any additives. It takes a long time to mature the cheese, a minimum of 18 months before it can be savoured. The longer the cheese is matured, the more aromatic and spicy it tastes. It can be eaten in three different ways, depending on the cheese age. At 18 months, Sbrinz can be sliced or shaved into rolls. At 24 months or even longer, Sbrinz develops full flavour and is served as an aperitif or broken up into pieces ('Möckli') on a cheeseboard. Last but not least, grated Sbrinz with its spicy aroma is perfect for adding a finishing touch to many pastas, risotto or au gratin dishes. This versatile cheese is often used instead of Parmesan cheese in Swiss cuisine.",

Scamorza is made in Italian regions like Apulia, Campania, Molise and in the USA. At the end of the cheese-making process, the cheese is hung together in strings to ripen for about two weeks. The process of ripening the cheese has given its name: Scamorza, which means 'beheaded' in southern Italy. After two weeks of ripening, the cheese is sold as it is or smoked. The smoked variant, called Scamorzi Affumicate (Smoked Scamorza) is made by smoking the cheese over flaming straw for around 10 to 15 minutes. A fresh version of Scamorza is also sold within a few days of production. The texture of Scamorza is elastic and stringy with piquant, milky and creamy flavours. Smoked Scamorza has a subtle, smoky flavour with a sweet, light caramel note. Scamorza is used as a substitute for Mozzarella as it imparts more interest in the recipe. Since Scamorza has excellent melting qualities, it is best known to flavour baking dishes for griddling or topped with prosciutto for extra zest. The smoky flavour of Scamorza pairs well with oak-aged Chardonnay, Pinot Girgio or Orvieto.",

Seriously Strong Spreadable Chilli: Flavoured with chilli for that extra kick, this bold spreadable cheese tastes best with crusty bread, crackers, toast or just as a dip. Seriously Strong Spreadable Smokey: Treated by smoke curing, Seriously Strong Spreadable Smokey offers a well rounded, balanced taste. As with other spreadable, it tastes well with toast or crackers. Seriously Strong Vintage Cheddar: Matured for a minimum of 18 months, the full bodied – bold flavour with sharp caramel notes highlights the taste of baked dishes.

This mould-ripened cheese has a white rind with smooth and creamy texture when 4 weeks old. As it ages, it becomes softer and creamier. Shepherd's Crook is allowed to mature for more days than its sibling, Little Ryding, that gives it a little taller, narrower shape and milder and firmer texture. With rich and sweet flavour, it works as an appetizer. Because of vegetarian rennet and 48% fat, it suites vegetarians. It can be served with Riesling. Available in round shape - Little Ryding weighs about 220g.",

Their Jack cheese is rubbed with a mixture of oil, pepper and unsweetened cocoa to give its signature brown rind. The rind protects the cheese but itself doesn’t have any effect on the flavour of the underlying cheese. Original Monterey Jack is the most popular variety of Jack cheese, but the same creaminess and texture can be found in Jacks flavoured with jalapeños, rosemary, habañero chillies and garlic. Dry Jack adds another dimension to a dazzling variety of mouthwatering Sonoma Jack cheeses. It is sold at different ages from ten months up to four years. The texture is firm, dry and becomes increasingly brittle with age. The flavours of Jack cheese may range from mild and mellow to high moisture Jacks to spicy, delicate and buttery in peppered versions. Dry Jack tends to produce a distinctly sweet, mushroom and earthy flavour. Jack cheeses pair excellently with Pinot Noir, Rose, Shiraz, Zinfandel or Riesling.",

Milk of rare Gloucester cattle is used to produce the cheese though sometimes their milk is mixed with the milk of Friesian cattle. Made with vegetarian rennet, this cheese is also suitable for vegetarians. The rind is washed in perry, an alcoholic drink made with the local variety of Stinking Bishop pear, which gives the cheese its name. The alcoholic wash gives the cheese a distinctive pungent aroma and brown/pink rind colour. As a result of the natural rind, changeable hues of mould spots appear on the cheese from time to time. This unique cheese dates its history to the Cistercian order of monks. Stinking Bishop is also matured in humid cave-like conditions to keep up with the tradition of monastic cheese. The colour of the cheese paste varies from white-yellow to beige, with an orange to a grey rind. It is available in 5lbs wheels, measuring 8-inches in diameter and 2-inches deep. The affinage takes from six to eight weeks. Stinking Bishop is produced in very limited quantities, but its stinky smell has made it popular in the United Kingdom and abroad.",

        "decription": "Taleggio is a smear-ripened Italian cheese named after the caves of Val Taleggio. It is one of the oldest soft cheeses produced every autumn and winter. During cheese making, the acidic milk is brought to the lab and kept on the wood shelves in the chambers and caves according to tradition. To prevent the cheese from mould infestation, it is washed with seawater once a week. The maturation takes 6 to 10 weeks to form a thin crust. These days the cheese is made from pasteurised and unpasteurised milk in factories. These factory-made cheeses have brighter and moderate flavours. Taleggio has been granted a PDO designation and contains 48% fat. The cheese has a strong smell, but the taste is relatively mild, with an unusual fruity tang. Taleggio can be served grated on salads. Since it melts well, it can be used in risotto or polenta.",

There are several varieties of Teifi, depending on the maturation period. When young, the cheese has a mellow, slightly sweet flavour and a smooth, creamy texture. As it matures, it develops deep, rich flavours with a hard and almost flaky texture, similar to Parmesan. The affinage usually takes two to nine months. Sometimes nettles, seaweeds, garlic, onion, sweet pepper and cumins are added for a distinct flavour. Available variants of Teifi cheese are: Natural Teifi Cheese, Seaweed Teifi Cheese, Onion and Garlic Teifi Cheese, Nettle Teifi Cheese, Cumin Teifi Cheese, Sweet Pepper Teifi Cheese, Oak Smoked Teifi Cheese, Mature Teifi Cheese and Chilli Teifi Cheese.

Whole fat Toma goes well with Italian dishes such as frittata, gnocchi, and risotto and pasta fillings.

As the cheese ripens, the paste becomes softer just under the rind, ensuring more herbaceous flavour.

This cheese is also made in other parts of Switzerland including the Jura Mountains on the border of France. The milk for the cheese is sourced from Fribourgeois breed of cows that graze on the Alpine grass and wildflowers all the way through the late spring and summer. As early fall arrives, the cows are brought down to graze on grass and summer hay. No other fodder is given to the cows except the Alpine meadows. This traditional cheese making process ensures that Vacherin Fribourgeois has a pleasant nutty flavour underpinned by notes of fresh hay and milk. Vacherin has an unpalatable natural and brushed washed rind with a stinky aroma, but it does not overpower the lovely smell of the cheese. The interior of the cheese is straw coloured with an open and buttery texture. Today Vacherin Fribourgeois is produced only by a small number of artisanal cheese makers and hence is very difficult to find. It has a Swiss AOC status with 6 varieties available: Classic (aged 6-12 weeks), Extra (aged minimum 12 weeks), Rustic (aged minimum 12 weeks, but up to 25 weeks (6 months)), Alpage (aged 12–25 weeks), Mountain (aged 9–25 weeks) and Organic (aged minimum 9 weeks). Vacherin Fribourgeois is used in fondues, cooking and as a table cheese. It is a great melting cheese, so try it on grilled sandwiches, potatoes or over steamed vegetables. Big and bold Burgundy’s, Bordeaux or reds from the Rhone Valley in France will complement the cheese well.",

Västerbottensost is a hard, granular cheese with a distinct character and powerful aromatic aroma. The taste is similar to Parmesan cheese, salty but with sweeter notes. Also, the texture is crumblier than an Italian Parmigianino Reggiano. It is a slow-maturing cheese with a minimum of a one-year ripening period. Light yellow in colour, Västerbottensost is a full-fat cheese containing 31% fat. Since the production is limited, it is twice as expensive as other aged cheeses. It is usually produced in the shape of a wheel, with smooth, yellow waxed rind.

Taking its name from the famous folk song of southern Indiana, Wabash Cannonball is dusted with ash and left to mature for about three to five weeks. When it is young, the chevre is thin-skinned, white, and slightly wrinkled, but as it starts to ripen, the Geotrichum and Candidum rind becomes more wrinkled allowing the ash to shine through. The pate becomes denser and finally, at three to five weeks, the cheese is drier and crumbly. Though, it can be enjoyed in all its stages. Wabash Cannonball is a dense sphere with a gentle, creamy, slightly acidic flavour with clean citrusy hints. The rind is a fluffy mushroomy snowball-like covering of Penicillium Candidum mould which gives way to a deeply wrinkled surface of Geotrichum Candidum as it matures. At its optimum age, the cheese is musky, slightly sweet with a more delicate flavour. Cannonball is best on a cheeseboard, served with dry white wines such as Sauvignon Blanc or Gruner Veltliner. It has been Best-of-Show, American Cheese Society 1995.",

        "decription": "Yorkshire Wensleydale or simply Wensleydale is a historic mild cheese that has been made in Wensleydale, North Yorkshire since 1150 by Cistercian monks. These monks continued to make the cheese until the dissolution of their monasteries in 1540. Traditionally the cheese was made using sheep's milk. The art of making the cheese was passed by the monks to the farmer's wives who produced a blue variety of Wensleydale at their farmhouses. Today, Wensleydale is produced mainly from pasteurised cow's milk and sheep's milk to enhance the flavour. Wensleydale Creamery in the town of Hawes is seeking to protect the name Yorkshire Wensleydale Cheese under PDO designation. But there are other producers of Wensleydale cheese in parts of the UK, mainly in Shropshire and Cheshire. Wensleydale Creamery produces five types of Wensleydale cheese depending on the age and flavours - Real Yorkshire Wensleydale, Mature Wensleydale, Extra Mature Wensleydale, Blue Wensleydale and Oak Smoked Wensleydale. A Real Yorkshire Wensleydale is creamy-white in colour has a supple, crumbly, moist and flaky texture. It appears similar to a young Caerphilly. The flavour is mild, clean, and slightly sweet with hints of wild honey savour and fresh acidity. As it ages the cheese develops a fuller, deeper flavour as well becomes firmer. Yorkshire Wensleydale cheese produced by Wensleydale Creamery is available in truckles/cylinders or block shaped in varying shapes and sizes up to 25kg. Wensleydale goes well with fruit cake, apple and is a perfect accompaniment during lunchtime or tea time. It also tastes delicious with hot desserts like fruit pies and crumbles. It is the king of cheeseboard where its fresh, milky sweetness and robust flavours rule the roost. Varieties: Oak Smoked Wensleydale is produced by naturally smoking the cheese for 18 hours using oak chips, to create a subtle, smoked flavour. It is the same as Real Yorkshire Wensleydale except for the striking golden beech colour and the robust flavour imparted by the smokiness. Mature Wensleydale is a harder, flavoured variant of Wensleydale. Extra Mature Wensleydale is the strongest Wensleydale aged for nine months. Blue Wensleydale is a blue-veined cheese that has been the supreme champion winner at the British Cheese Awards 2012. Unpasteurized Wensleydale handcrafted from a single dairy herd is also available. It has a complex lemony flavour with a buttery and creamy texture. Blended Wensleydale, flavoured with delicate fruits like cranberries, apricots, pineapples, ginger, garlic and chives is one of the favourites buys at the creamery. Wensleydale cheeses complement fruity white wine such as Pinot Grigio.",

The cheese was created initially by Marisa Mauro's Ploughgate Creamery, but after a fire in 2011, Jaspers resurrected the recipe and continued to make it at their farm.This washed-rind cheese is made from pasteurized cow's milk. It has a semi-soft, buttery texture with occasional eyes and pale yellow caramel paste. Flavours range from delicate milky, herbal, ripe-peach that advance into peat, roasted beef and onions aromas imparted by the rind. The cheese is aged for 6 to 12 weeks.Willoughby pairs perfectly with a Rose, Saison beer or raw floral honey.",

It has a pale-yellow colour with a crumbly texture. Due to a distinctive zigzag pattern of rind and cylindrical shape, Zamorano appears similar to Castellano or Manchego. It gets a characteristic flavour because of the small, scruffy Churra and the Castilian sheep breed. This sweet, nutty and salty cheese is served as a table cheese with White, Red, and Zinfandel wine. ",

Grana Padano, made in Northern Italy around the Po Valley, is an Italian cow's milk cheese. Controlled by the Grana Padana Consorzio Zanetti, the cheese is aged for a minimum of 18 months and carries a mark on the wheel. It is easily recognized because of the enormous wheels, usually ranging from 70 to 88 pounds. This is a special four-leaf clover and indicates the province of origin. Look for the Zanetti mark to ensure you are buying the best. Grana Padano could be called the bodybuilder since it is low in fat and very high in protein and calcium. It is easily digested because, during the maturation process, the proteins are broken down into amino acids. ",

This is an unusual treat as blue cheeses are generally not made in this area.It is a semi-hard cheese with uniform blue veins and a dense, mellow-flavoured interior. The natural rind is somewhat dry when the cheese is young, but with age it becomes moist, resulting in an extra tangy richness.  Cheese made in spring is light in taste and texture whilst those from the coming winter season have more strong, intense flavours and heavier texture. The range of flavour varies from sweet butter to lemon zest and peppery. Accompany the cheese with Juracon Moelleux or Port.",
