They used unpasteurised sheep milk available in the locality and followed a cheese-making process that dates back to 3000 years. Abbaye de Belloc is a flat wheel-shaped traditional, farmhouse, semi-hard cheese made from sheep's milk. It has a natural, crusty, brownish rind with patches of red, orange and yellow. The rind is marked with tiny craters. The cheese has a firm, dense, rich and creamy texture. The taste resembles burnt caramel, and there is a distinctive lanolin aroma. The ageing process of the cheese ranges from four to ten months. The younger wheels are made in December, while the older ones are in July. Both types of cheese wheels are sent to the market in April."

The highlight of the cheese is that it is regularly washed with Chablis, a local high-status white wine until the maturing process is over. This bath in wine slowly makes its impact on the yellow-orangish ferments inside the cheese. As it nears maturity, the cheese glows of a deep copper pigmentation to reveal the richness of Burgundian soils. Once the cheese is removed from the wooden box, it turns extremely creamy and velvety. The texture is dense covered by a soft, moist, orange rind. The mild, savoury flavour perfectly sets off the strong, aromatic smell of the cheese. It goes well with sweet and acidic fruits. It augments the flavour of dry white wines like Chardonnay and of course Chablis."

The cheese is produced from cow's full-fat milk in towns that dot the lower basins of river Narcea and river Nalón in the central Asturias-Northern Spain. It is made by curdling in a mould at a temperature of between 20° and 25°C (68° and 77°F), for 10 to 48 hours. During its preparation, animal rennet is added. The cheese comes in different types recognised by its shape, added ingredients, and the ageing period. The cheese is also available in three varieties, Cured, Semi-cured and Soft, depending on the ageing period. Though this cheese is produced all year round, the best type is the one made during spring and winter as the fat content of the milk is at its highest! Afuega'l Pitu is eaten either when fresh and slightly aired or once matured after several weeks in a fresh, damp, well-ventilated atmosphere."

If truth be told, it is one of the most popular cheeses globally, accounting for 50 to 60% of the world's cheese consumption. There are several types of Gouda, classified by age. From all of these, hard-core Gouda fans prefer to taste the aged Gouda, as they feel it takes years of maturing to bring out the complex flavours of the cheese. Aged Gouda is prepared similar to other Gouda cheeses by separating curds and whey through a heating process. As with all other cheeses, aged Gouda gets its colour by adding a colouring agent called annatto. With ageing, Gouda develops calcium lactate crystals formed by the lactic acid in the cheese. It proffers an enjoyable crunch that is unique to waxed cheeses. However, the rind of a five-year aged Gouda is unfit for human consumption. The longer a cheese is kept in maturation cellars, the more aromatic and full-flavoured it becomes. Similarly, Aged Gouda, such as a five-year aged cheese, develops a strong flavour that cheese aficionados prefer to eat alone. Accompaniments seem pale in comparison to their caramel and robust flavour. Gouda cheese goes well with beer and red wines. The taste of Vintage or Aged Gouda gets a new definition when paired with some white wines and fruity wines."

Before and after rolling it with a coat of ash, the cheese is washed in Marc de Bourgogne wine. Aisy Cendre takes a longer time to mature than normal cheeses, at least a month. As it ripens the pate softens but most cheese lovers enjoy a somewhat firm version of the produce. The aroma of Aisy Cendre is strong and the flavour is aggressive. It is a very rich & creamy cheese with 50% fat content. The centre of the cheese is salty, chalky and almost white in colour. As it moves towards the ash-covered rind, the cheese assumes a smoky flavour and smoother, creamier texture. The cheese is sold in small wheels, weighing 8 ounces each. Aisy Cendre works well with fruits like apples and pears, celery sticks. It enhances the tasting experience for fruity, full-bodied Burgundy wine, Hautes Cotes de Nuits Villages or even a full-rounded beer."

It is said that the Druids and the Gauls had developed the art of making this unique cheese. In 2002 it was separated from the Fourme de Montbrison, an identical cheese, to receive an individual AOC status. The cheese is a traditional, farmhouse blue cheese that can be either co-operative or artisanal. Fourme d'Ambert is more supple and dense than most blues. Milk from cows grazing on either lower or higher mountain pastures is used to produce the cheese. Although the cheese matures in 40 days, it is cave-aged for two-three months for optimum quality. During the ageing time, it is injected with Vouvray moelleux, a sweet white wine. It is easily recognizable by its unusually tall cylindrical shape. The pâté is cream coloured with prominent blue veining. The cheese is inoculated with Penicillium roqueforti spores for the growth of blue veins. Slightly tangy, savoury flavour infused by the bacteria, beautifully complements the distinct notes of butter and cream. Wine connoisseurs can enjoy the cheese with Sauternes and other dessert wines as well as full-bodied reds such as Rhone’s, Pinot Noirs and Syrah. Similar cheeses include Fourme de Montbrison, Bleu de Montbrison, Bleu de Gex and Bleu de Septmoncel. Try the cheese as a snack with bread and fruit or crumble it on salads."

Under the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations, American cheese is a type of pasteurised processed cheese. The taste and texture of American cheese vary depending on the usage of cheese and additives. Also, the colour may change from orange and yellow to white from manufacturer to manufacturer. Processed American cheese is sold in three varieties – individually wrapped cheese slices, small pre-sliced blocks and large blocks.  Although criticized for its high fat and sodium content, American cheese is still used in cooking as it melts well and contains a good amount of calcium and protein."

It is mildly salted and usually served at breakfast with honey, jam or filled in pastries. Fresh Anari should be consumed soon as it is very perishable. When Anari is salted and air-dried in the sun or in an oven, it achieves a very hard and brittle cheese with a mild salty taste. Dry Anari is too hard to cut and is hence grated and used in garnishing pasta dishes."

It is a product that is peelable and when it is peeled, it separates from the larger cheese in strips. Most of the cheeses cannot be peeled because of the way they are processed. The curds are pressed into blocks resulting in the cheese either crumbling or breaking apart. In the case of string cheese, the curds are worked into elastic strips, which are then plaited or twisted. This creates fibres of cheese that can be pulled away in strings. Cow, sheep, and goat milk can be used in the preparation of string cheese. It is popular with children as it is an excellent source of protein and calcium. In the MidEast countries such as Armenia and Syria, traditional string cheese is prepared from goat or sheep’s milk. In some places, it is made from 100% whole milk of cow. The cheese is flavoured with various spices including black cumin, nigella seeds and a unique Middle Eastern spice known as mahleb. The cheese is available in an indefinite plaited loop. In Syria, string cheese is known by its Arabic name ‘Jibneh Mshallaleh’. Middle Eastern string cheese goes well with Lebanese bread and liquorice flavoured Greek liqueur, Ouzo. The flavour of Middle Eastern string cheese varies from velvety, buttery to a sharp, tangy one. Texturally, it is firm and flexible besides giving a thread feeling in the mouth. Many people associate Mozzarella with string cheese as it can be plucked apart in logs."

However, Lacy cheese has a different taste and smell than Baby Swiss. Baby Swiss and Lacy Swiss are two varieties of Swiss cheese. Both come with small holes and a mild flavour. Baby Swiss is made from whole milk, while Lacy Swiss is from low-fat milk. Derived from traditional Swiss cheese, Baby Swiss has many small 'eyes'. Its colour ranges from ivory to pale yellow. It has a mild taste and smooth, creamy texture that distinguish it from other types of cheese. When shredded, Baby Swiss melts well. The buttery, somewhat nutty and sweet flavour goes well with sweet fruits and berries, croissants and muffins, white and red wine, juices and even ice-cold milk.

Granted AOC status in 2003, Banon also known as Banon à la feuille is a very old, traditional cheese said to date back to the Gallo-Roman era. The cheese is wrapped in a case of chestnut leaves, held in place with raffia. Cheesemakers gather the leaves in autumn when they fall off the trees. Some producers dip the leaves and raffia in vinegar or eau-de-vie to impart a unique flavour to the cheese. Banon is aged for a minimum of two weeks. As it ages further, the soft & sticky cheese develops blue and grey moulds on and under the leaves, leading to a strong and intense flavour. The casing of leaves protects the washed-rind disc and allows the young, slightly acidic cheese to remain moist. It also imparts a fresh vegetable flavour with a hint of wine. Banon cheeses range from a firm, mild and lactic to soft, creamy and tart, with a nutty flavour. The local expertise, Fromage Fort du Mont Ventoux, is manufactured by positioning a young Banon cheese (without chestnut leaves) in an earthenware crock, seasoning it with salt and pepper and pouring over vinegar or local eau-de-vie. The crock is often placed in a cool cellar, and the cheese is left to ferment with just a sporadic stir. The longer it is left, the stronger it becomes. Banon goes well with a crusty baguette, fresh fruits and a glass of dry white wine."

It tastes awesome with tomatoes, basil, pita bread and water wheel crackers. Some people prefer to relish the taste by eating it along with jam or honey at breakfast. Since the cheese doesn’t melt away easily, many Indian cuisines use it as a replacement for paneer. The old-fashioned fruit and cheese platter also works wonders with Basket cheese.

Brothers Andy and Mateo Kehler who own the farm, developed the recipe for Bayley Hazen Blue by altering the shape and ageing process of a Devon Blue recipe from England so that the cheese rind will hold up in usual retail conditions.The texture of Bayley Hazen Blue is firm and slightly dry than other blues. However, it is also dense and creamy, with well-distributed blue veins. The cream-coloured paste is characterized by the deep, dark heartiness of pepper, tobacco and roasted hazelnuts set off by subdued grassy, nutty flavours in the milk.Bayley Hazen Blue tastes beautiful with a glass of fruity red dessert wine, toasty Imperial Stout, or a chunk of dark chocolate. Pair it with a spinach salad, walnuts, and dried tart cherries to accentuate its flavour. This celebrated cheese has won many international awards including Super gold at the 2014 World Cheese Awards. It has been judged as one of the world's 62 best cheeses."

This peculiar blackened rind is achieved only when the wheels are hand coated with a mixture of clay called \"umber\" (ochre), grape seed oil and carbon black. The coating on the rind differentiates it from various Parmesan-style cheeses as well as is a tribute to the Lodi tradition. Bella Lodi is made without preservatives or added allergens, using milk that comes from cows in the Lodi area. It is white in colour, with an intense and fragrant smell; full flavour that is not too sharp or salty. The characteristics do not change much even in summer.

It was formulated by Egidio Galbani in 1906 who wanted to invent a product that would compete with French Alpine cheeses. The name is derived from a book by Abbot Antonio Stoppani \"Il Bel Paese\", published in 1873. The cheese has a milky aroma infused with a mild buttery flavour. The taste can be compared with Mozzarella and St. Paulin. The pale yellow cheese may occasionally be riddled with “eyes”. The cheese is hard to spread but soft enough to slice. It is wrapped in a waxed, foil or plastic rind. Bel Paese takes 6 to 8 weeks to mature and comes in several different sizes from small buttons to large 5lb wheels. An original Bel Paese can be identified by a map of Italy and a picture of Antonio Stoppani on the label of the cheese. The American version has a map of United States on the label. The Italian cheese goes well with fruits like apples, pears and figs. As it has good melting capacity, it is often used in casseroles, hot Panini, focaccio or on a pizza. It can be eaten with fruity wines, such as dry red or white."

It was awarded AOC status in 1975 and is available in both artisanal and industrial versions. Bleu d'Auvergne is creamy ivory-coloured cheese dotted with blue-green mould due to the Penicillium roqueforti, which gives the cheese its typical bluish-green veins. It is aged for a minimum of 4 weeks, which results in assertive flavours and a smooth texture. The rind is moist and sticky, unveiling a soft paste with a grassy, herbaceous, and spicy, peppery, salty, pungent taste. The strong aroma and full-flavoured characteristics of the cheese are at their optimum when served with sweet dessert wines such as riesling and sauvignon blanc or strong, robust red wines. Cheese is often used in salad dressings and pasta."

Bleu de Laqueuille is only made during the summer and autumn months from the pasteurised milk of Saler cows. It is a typical blue cheese with pockets of blue-green mould observed throughout the off-white interior. The outer shell of this cylindrical cheese is made up of dry, gray, natural rind.

Traditionally, the cheese was made from a mixture of sheep's milk mixed either with cow's or goat's milk. But according to French cheese laws, the cheese came to be made exclusively from cow's milk. Bleu des Causses has a high-fat content of 45% and is matured for at least seventy days. However, the cheese can also be matured for up to six months in Causses plateau in natural limestone caves. The cheese is similar to Blue d'Auvergne in many ways, despite Bleu des Causses having a noticeably firmer, creamier texture and spicy flavours. Bleu des Causses produced in winter and summer slightly differ in texture and flavour. Cheeses made in winter are light in colour than their summer equals. The winter produce also tends to be slightly drier. A taste of the Bleu des Causses will proffer a blend of rich milkiness amidst the peppery and spicy notes of the blue mould. The summer produce brings out its unique grassy and clover flavours. It pairs excellently with sweet white wine and dessert wines such as Sauternes or Mulderbosch Late Harvest Sauvignon Blanc."

Since then the cheese has always been made with a flattened top.Bloomsdale is rolled in a mixture of pine ash and salt and aged until it forms a beautiful bloom of white mould. As it ages, the cheese starts becoming runnier just below the rind. The flavours will intensify, developing some blue cheese notes though it is not one. The rind extends an earthy taste to the lactic, tangy paste inside."

The Penicillium mold cultures are added at the initial stage of the cheesemaking process, giving it blue or green spots or veins throughout the cheese. The creamy texture and a pungent aroma from mold or cultivated bacteria tend to be the characteristic feature of blue cheese. For some blue cheeses, spores are injected before the formation of curds, and for some cheeses, spores are mixed in with the curds. During ageing, the blue cheeses are kept in temperature-controlled environments such as caves. Australia has made historic progress in producing a variety of Blue Cheeses. The cheesemakers of Australia have been making blue-veined cheese for over 70 years. The first blue cheese factories were recorded to have started in northern New South Wales and Gippsland in the 1930s and 1940s. At present, more than 22 styles of blue cheese are produced in Australia. Australia produces three basic types of blue cheese – Gorgonzola, Danish and Blue Brie."

The final product is characterized by green, grey, blue or black veins or spots of mould throughout the body. These veins are created during the production stage when cheese is 'spiked' with stainless steel rods to let oxygen circulate and encourage the growth of the mould. This process also softens the texture and develops a distinctive blue flavour. The origin of Blue cheese has an interesting story. It is thought to have been invented by accident when a drunken cheesemaker left behind a half-eaten loaf of bread in moist cheese caves. When he returned back, he discovered that the mould covering the bread had transformed it into a blue cheese. Blue cheese is also identified by a peculiar smell that comes from cultivated bacteria. The flavour of the cheese depends on the type of blue cheese, shape, size, the climate of the curing and ageing period. But it generally tends to be sharp and salty. Some of the famous blue cheese around the world are Roquefort from France, Gorgonzola from Italy and Stilton from England. Blue cheese tastes best when served with crackers, pears, raisins, fruit bread and walnuts. Crumble the cheese and melt it into sour cream, plain yoghurt or mayonnaise as a dressing."

The art of making the cheese was passed by the monks to the farmer’s wives who produced a blue variety of Wensleydale at their farmhouses. Today, Wensleydale is produced mainly from pasteurised cow’s milk with sheep’s milk added to enhance the flavour. Wensleydale Creamery in the town of Hawes is seeking to protect the name Yorkshire Wensleydale Cheese under PDO designation. But there are other producers of Wensleydale cheese in parts of the UK, mainly in Shropshire and Cheshire. Blue Wensleydale is a handcrafted cheese made exclusively by Wensleydale Dairy Products in the town of Hawes. It was invented by Thomas Nuttall in the late 19th century. The recipe is a variation of the famous Stilton cheese but firmer. It is matured for six months and lightly pressed for only 24 hours before being wrapped in a muslin cloth. The mellow and less salty Blue Wensleydale appeals to many newcomers and cheese connoisseurs alike."

Nowadays, Bocconcini’s are usually made from a mixture of water buffalo and cow’s milk. Since this delicious cheese is perishable, it is best consumed fresh. Bocconcini, using traditional methods of cheese making and water buffalo’s milk, are still made in the provinces of Naples, Caserta and Salerno, as bocconcini alla panna di bufala.

Another variant called Bocconcino di Bufala Campana DOP is also produced, which is simply, Mozzarella di Bufala Campana DOP in egg sized balls.  These bite-sized cheeses have a refreshingly delicate and creamy aroma. Because of its elastic texture and consistency, Italians like to savour them in a salad, wrap it in prosciutto or serve them with a spinach dish known as Bocconcini Sorentina. A variety of Italian dishes can be spruced up by the very sweet and very light butter taste of Bocconcini.

The cheese has a thin, bloomy rind due to a coating of light penicillin mould. Affinage of Boursault takes about two months, with one more month in packaging. As the cheese ages, it acquires a mushroomy and refreshing citrusy taste. The cheese sold in small cylinder-shaped rounds should be consumed within a week of purchase.

Today, the cheese is available in various flavours whose availability varies from country to country. In most cases, Boursin is spiced up with herbs like tomato, onion, chive, fig, nuts, garlic, pepper, shallot, cranberry, fine herbs & cinnamon. A favourite member from the Boursin family is a low-fat version with only 21% fat and is flavoured with garlic & herbs. Add the original Boursin cheese to salads, pasta or serve it as a typical appetizer. It can be spread on crackers and bread or used on raw vegetables such as carrots, celery and peppers. Also, the cheese melts well to create a smooth sauce for pasta and chicken. This cheese is a favourite brand amongst top chefs.

As it ripens, its flavour becomes increasingly spicy and salty. "

He named this cheese as ‘Breakfast cheese’ and sold it in saloons where it was served on the bar as an alternative for pickled eggs. Pasteurised cow’s milk is used to prepare the cheese. After brining, for about 2 hours they are dried and sold at a very young age of 3 days. The texture of breakfast cheese is firm, slightly dense and clay-like. It is ivory white in colour. It tastes of salt and cream with a citrus tang. The pronounced flavour tastes excellent with bread and fruit and can be eaten at any time of a day as a snack."

The process of making Brick cheese is borrowed from white American Cheddar, although the resultant produces a slightly soft and distinctly sharper tasting cheese. Many associate Brick cheese with Germany’s surface ripened Beer cheese or Beer Käse. The name Brick is derived from the original cheese making process when artisans used Brick to press the moisture out of the cheese. An original Wisconsin Brick cheese is smear-ripened with Corynebacterium and Arthrobacter bacteria to develop a full, earthy flavour. As a Brick cheese matures, the mild and sweet flavour changes to pungent and tangy with a touch of nuttiness. The pate is smooth, open and creamy yellow covered by a washed rind on the outside. Serve Brick cheese with macaroni, potatoes au gratin, pickled vegetables or on toasted Italian bread. Young Brick cheese goes well with light red wines, Gamay Beaujolais and sweet pickles. Whilst, an aged Brick pairs with robust beers, Porter style ale and hard cider."

Several hundred years ago, Brie was one of the tributes which had to be paid to the French kings. In France, Brie is very different from the cheese exported to the United States. Real French Brie is unstabilized and the flavour is complex when the surface turns slightly brown. When the cheese is still pure-white, it is not matured. If the cheese is cut before the maturing process, it will never develop properly. Exported Brie, however, is stabilized and never matures. Stabilized Brie has a much longer shelf life and is not susceptible to bacteriological infections. Brie is produced from the whole or semi-skimmed cow's milk. Rennet is added to the raw milk and heated to a temperature of 37°C (99°F) to obtain the curd.  The cheese is then cast into moulds, several layers of cheese are filled into the mould and then kept for around 18 hours. After this, the cheese is salted and aged for a minimum of four weeks. Brie cheese is slightly pale in colour with a greyish tinge under a rind. Its flavour varies depending upon the ingredients added while producing the cheese. Brie, one of the great dessert cheeses, comes as either a 1 or 2-kilogram wheel and is packed in a wooden box. In order to enjoy the taste fully, Brie must be served at room temperature. Please note: Pasteurized milk is required in the United States and Australia."

Evidence in the chronicles of Charlemagne suggests the tasting of Brie by the Emperor in the year 774. In 1814, the European Tournament at the Congress of Vienna awarded Brie de Meaux the \"Le Roi des Fromages\" (The King of Cheeses) for its unarguable flavour and texture. Brie de Meaux, an AOC cheese, should be matured in the regions of Seine-et-Marne, Loiret, Aube, Marne, Haut-Marne, Meuse and Yonne. The difference between production and maturation places is a typical Brie tradition. This is a soft, unpasteurised cow's milk cheese covered with a bloomy rind resulting from inoculation with Penicillium Candidum moulds. As the cheese ages, the rind develops red or brown patches. When nearly half of the straw-coloured pate becomes soft, it indicates Brie de Meaux is ready for consumption. Brie has a milky and rich taste underlined by sweet and buttery flavours of mushrooms or truffles and almonds. The cheese pairs well with Champagne, a red Bordeaux or Bourgogne (Burgundy)."

It was granted an AOC protection in 1980 that requires that the cheese be manufactured under strict guidelines for supreme quality. Brie de Melun is produced from either whole or skimmed, raw milk of cows grazing in the valleys of Seine et Marne and some departments of Aube and Yonne. It is semi-soft cheese inoculated with a Penicillium mould and aged in a cellar for at least 4-5 weeks. If the cheese is left to ripen for a longer period, say several months, it matures to a Brie Noir.  It is an aromatic cheese with slightly musty and straw-like smells floating in the air. Over-ripening the Brie can result in an unpleasant odour from bacteria used to ripen the mould. The texture is semi-soft, and the rind is slightly dry. The rind turns darker and crumbly as the cheese matures to a Brie Noir. In addition, the pate is drier and darker, and the flavour is stronger to taste. The usual flavours are strongly lactic and slightly salty, finished by soft, barnyard, sour notes. Brie de Melun is used to prepare regional dishes like croûte au brie. It pairs well with Gaillac and wines from Burgundy or the Rhone Valley."

Since classified as triple cream cheese, Brillat-Savarin has a fat content of at least 75% achieved by adding rich, luscious cream to pasteurized cow's milk. Young cheese tastes similar to fresh cheese but usually, it is matured for about four to five weeks to develop more complex flavours. A matured Brillat-Savarin has a typical white, bloomy rind with an interior paste that is buttery-white in colour. The texture is dense, moist, and slightly chalky with enough lusciousness and creaminess. The cheese has a milky aroma with lemon sour tones. Flavours are of butter and fresh cream. Brillat-Savarin pairs well with Pale Ale and Champagne and sometimes with a Domaine Chandon Rosé or a Viognier."

One more variety of Bryndza contains only sheep's milk and is called liptovská or ovčia bryndza.The Slovak variety of Bryndza contains 50% sheep's milk, and the Polish variety of Bryndza contains 60% sheep's milk. In contrast, 100% sheep's milk is used to make liptovská or ovčia bryndza, the least produced variety of Bryndza.The texture, flavour and colour of Bryndza depend on how it is made. Generally, the cheese is salty and crumbly if common salt is used, but some producers add saline solution to make it salty, changing the texture to soft and spreadable. The cheese is white to grey in colour, tangy and slightly moist. The flavour graph starts from slightly mild to strong and then fades with a salty finish. Bryndza is the main ingredient in bryndzové halušky, the national favourite of Slovakia. "

It tastes best when fresh and creamy. Though it is covered in charcoal powder which is edible, it is preferably eaten without the rind. Buchette d'Anjou is used as table cheese. Also, as it grills well, it is served along with salads."

Burgos cheese was made using sheep's milk during the olden days, but nowadays, cow's milk or mixtures (raw or pasteurised) are also used to produce variations. The traditional method of its preparation required maturation for up to 10 days. But, in today's improved technologies, preparing Burgos cheese can be extended to about 30 days. Burgos is considered one of the most prestigious cheeses, which is usually accompanied by other foods like honey, quince or walnuts.

These areas are located at the foot of the Picos de Europa Mountains in Asturias. The cheese can be made from unpasteurised cow’s milk or blended with goat and/or sheep milk. It is aged between two and four months in naturally formed limestone caves. Chilly and humid conditions in the caves facilitate the growth of bluish-green penicillium mould on this cheese. Unlike other blue cheeses injected with Penicillium, Cabrales cures from the outside of the cheese to the inward. A finished Cabrales can be characterised by its strong, penetrating aroma and sharp, acidic, slightly salty taste. It pairs well with red wine, fresh figs, salami, sweet sherry and dry sausages. The cheese is treasured as a base for sauces, melting over grilled or roasted meats. It goes well along with baguette slices, crackers, or fruit. Earlier, a traditional Cabrales was sold wrapped in moist leaves of Acer pseudoplatanus. But today, the regulation requires the cheese to be sold in a dark-green-coloured aluminium foil with the PDO Queso de Cabrales stamp."

The history of Caciocavallo goes back to 500 BC when Hippocrates first mentioned the cleverness of the Greeks in making it. Cheeses similar to Caciocavallo are common all over the Balkans and Southern Italy. In fact, Ragusano DOP from Sicily had to drop the name Caciocavallo Ragusano to achieve the DOP label. Continuous exposure to humidity in the caves and ageing develops sharp, spicy flavours in Caciocavallo. With persistent ageing, the cheese picks up intense, earthy undertones and fruity aromas. Along the way, it turns from a milky white to a darker yellow in colour and becomes saltier. The result is a cheese with profound tasting notes and a perfect accompaniment to a glass of Primitivo red wine."

Its texture and flavour resemble cheddar, the most popular cheese in the United Kingdom.  The recipe for Caerphilly has been inspired by other crumbly cheeses like Cheshire, young Lancashire and Wensleydale. It is said that the cheese was specially made for coal-miners as its rugged texture and shallow height made it easy for them to eat with bare hands, while the salty, moist curd helped to replenish the lost minerals. Caerphilly is made from unpasteurised cow's milk and matured anywhere from 8 to 10 to 14 days. Some variants are often kept for up to a year to develop a more rigid texture and more robust taste. Inside the pale ivory rind of the cheese, young Caerphilly has a fresh and pleasant taste alongside a moist yet supple texture. With maturity, the edges become creamy, and the flavour becomes more rounded. It usually has a wheel shape with ivory-white rind dusted with refined flour. As the cheese ages in a moist cellar, the white and grey moulds become thicker and more leathery. The cheese can be vegetarian, depending upon the brand. A basic white burgundy would go well with this cheese. It usually is grated or melted onto dishes."

They are then matured in natural caves at Castelcivita for 1-2 years by the Madaio family. Calcagno is a classic Pecorino with the sweetness and aroma influenced by the Mediterranean climate. The herbaceous flavour of the soft yellow pate is reflective of the wild herbs and grasses passed onto the cheese. The aging time gives the paste a compact, firm, flaky and smooth texture and distinctively marked rind. Eat this cheese with crusty bread and pair it with young red wine or a sharp dry white wine."

Unlike other cheddars, Canadian cheddars have a smoother, creamier texture as well proffer the right balance of flavour and sharpness. Depending on their age, the flavour, texture and aroma of cheddar cheese can vary. Cheddar is traditionally creamy white in colour but due to the addition of tasteless food colouring, it often appears dyed in an orange hue. The cheese can be made from raw, pasteurised or thermalized milk to retain more of the flavour-enhancing enzymes. Even if cow’s milk is the most commonly used source for making the cheese, it is not uncommon to find Canadian cheddar made from sheep or goat's milk. Cheddar ripens from inside out and is classified depending on its ageing time. In Canada, cheddar is produced almost entirely by a number of large companies in Ontario including limited artisanal producers. Of these, the most prize-winning cheddar maker in Canada is the Balderson Cheese Company. The cheese is aged for a minimum of three months and maximum up to six years for optimal supreme quality. Flavoured cheddar cheese spiced up with some popular flavours, made in Canada includes cranberry, dill, flax, garlic, jalapeno, olive and sun-dried tomato. Some of the common types of Canadian Cheddars are Lancashire, Double Gloucester, Wensleydale, Leicester, Derby, Cheshire, Cantal, Caerphilly and Colby. Mild Cheddar, Medium Cheddar and Marble Cheddar are ideal for snacking and with lighter foods like omelettes, sandwiches and as a garnish. Old Cheddar can be used for shredding, slicing and pairs well with white wines and pale ales/lager. Extra Old Cheddar compliments white wines, red wines & rose wines. It is best used for rich, creamy sauces, shredding, baking."

The PGI protection requires that the cheese be made with between 70% and 90% whole ewe's milk and between 10% and 30% whole goat's milk. The cylindrical-shaped cheese needs at least 60 days of maturation. Depending on the ageing period, the rind colour varies from yellow in \"primitivo\" (early produce) to straw-colour in \"stagionato\" (aged). On cutting, a white or light straw yellow Canestrato slice exhibits a sweet and delicate flavour efficacy, which intensifies with aging. An aged cheese will develop an intense and spicy flavour whilst the rind colour could be almost black due to a carbon soot water, vinegar and olive oil treatment. The cheese contains a minimum of 30% fat. Due to its hard texture, it has a good reputation as a table cheese and pairs well with fresh, raw vegetables and pears. It can also be grated on pasta and soups. Wines such as Greco di Tufo, Falanghina, Lacryma Christi del Vesuvio and Aglianico make a perfect match with the cheese. "

Cantal jeune -  a young cheese aged 30 to 60 days, during which it develops a thin grey-ivory crust and a smooth, pale yellow, close-textured paste. It is fresh, sweet, milky in flavour with a light hint of hazelnut and vanilla. Cantal entre-deux - a cheese aged between 3 to 9 months, has the flavours of green pastures and aromas of butter and cream. After three months of ripening, Cantal cheese starts to come into its own. The cheese is additionally grouped as \"fremier\" and \"laitier\", wherein fermier is a farmhouse cheese made of raw milk while laitier is the commercial, mass-produced version from pasteurised milk. Cantal works well with nuts, grapes, and apples and can be used in salads, soups, cheese fondue, or gratins. Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot are a few wines that pair nicely with Cantal."

Its similarity to camembert has earned Caravane the nickname, ‘camelbert cheese’. Her dairy, Tiviski, located in the capital of West African Mauritania makes this cheese with the help of milk collected from the local camel herds. Vegetable rennet and calcium phosphate is used in the cheese-making process for a better and unique yield. By using a special enzyme to achieve the correct consistency, the dairy produces Caravane, a soft cheese with a white crust. It is made using the bloomy-rind technique. Even though it is very difficult to produce this cheese, the low lactose content has a digestive advantage when preparing various dishes requiring less lactose. The cheese is used in cakes, dips, appetizers, savory meat and various vegetable preparations. Its creamy taste creates an exciting pairing with red wine. Since the Mauritanians don’t eat much cheese, the EU has not implemented regulation policies for dromedary camel products. This has made it difficult to source the cheese in Europe and America. However, with the help of Gary Guthrie, an American importer, the cheese is now available in select New York stores. Caravane is a very healthy cheese as it packs in more nutrients, anti-bacterial enzymes, low fat content and vitamins than regular cow’s, buffalo’s, sheep’s or goat’s cheese. In fact, it has 3 times more nutrients than cow’s milk."

The rennet used in making this cheese makes it suitable for vegetarians. Depending on the age, Cashel Blue's texture varies from chalky to soft yellow paste. Young cheese tastes & smells chalky and lactic, while the older ones are rich & buttery with a well-formed blue colour. Over 18 weeks of maturing, the cheese takes on a robust flavour and granular texture. It is one of the finest blue cheeses that relies on its balance in taste, texture and aroma. Young Cashel Blue pairs well with Gewurztraminer, while medium-aged wheels favour Sauternes and New World Botrytis Semillion. The aged cheeses are good with LBV Port. Pick the scrumptious cheese to crumble onto salads or snack on with grapes."

It is named after a Roman soldier who, despite being persecuted, kept on preaching gospels and gave its name to the famous sanctuary town of Castelmagno in Grana Valley. The cylindrical-shaped cheese is made from cow's milk with a small addition of sheep and/or goat's milk. The milk utilized must come from communes protected by PDO designation to guarantee the product's authenticity. The ageing takes two to five months to get the characteristic traditional flavour.  It is a dense cheese with no open holes tending towards a grainier, crumbly texture. The pate colour leans from ivory white towards ochre-yellow with the presence of bluish-green veins of penicillium moulds. Covering the pate is a thin reddish-yellow rind, which turns wrinkly, and brownish-ochre as the cheese matures. The subtle taste of Castelmagno gets stronger, spicier and sharper as it ages. Barolo, Reciota della Valpolicella, Chianti pair well with this cheese. It is appreciated as a table cheese and used to prepare typical Italian dishes such as gnocchi."

It is either round or half-cylinder shape with a rind that is engraved with the mark left by the wooden mould. The greyish-dark brown colour of the rind conceals a yellow coloured pate. This cheese comes from the Spanish region of Castile-Leon, which accounts for 85% production of pure sheep's milk cheese. Castigliano best represents the cheese-producing region. The ripening process of Castigliano lasts at least two months to develop a medium mature and mature age cheese. It comes in pieces ranging between a kilo and 3.5kg. The cheese is similar to Manchego but comparatively, it is quite moist and has a few rice-sized holes. Cheeses made with raw milk such as Castigliano have a spicy, cream-caramel, buttery flavour that is perfectly offset by the fresh acidity and hint of salt. The fruity tang of the table cheese when served with the classic Spanish quince or membrilla, takes the dish to a completely new level. Nowadays, a recent variety of cheese produced with a mixture of cows, ewes and goat’s milk has a somewhat mild flavour. Castigliano cheese goes well with good regional red wines."

The cheese is shaped like a truncated pyramid coated with oak ash/sea salt mix. It takes 3 days to make the cheese and has a shelf life of approximately four weeks. When 1 or 2 weeks old, Cerney has a soft mousse-like texture and a fresh mild flavour. The cheese develops deeper flavour as it ages. The shape and production of Cerney are very similar to Valencay, but the taste is very different with less of a goat flavour. The cheese is available in many different varieties including pepper-mix rolled, brandy washed and fresh rounds intended for grilling. Cerney Pyramid has been consistently awarded gold, silver & bronze medals at the World Cheese Awards. It has also won the popular title Supreme Champion in 2001 at the Global Cheese Awards.  This celebrated cheese has won Super gold award at the 2014 World Cheese Awards.

The cheese is produced only by a few farmsteads or cheese retailers, and it is sold locally. The cheese comes in the shape of a truncated cylinder called \"bonde\", approximately 6 cm in height and 5 to 6 cm in diameter. It is matured for a minimum of 10 days, but generally for 2 to 3 weeks or even more for vigorous flavour. Upon ageing, Chabichou develops a characteristic, edible wrinkled rind dotted with occasional grey patches. After cutting, the cheese reveals a firm, creamy “bright white” interior. Even though it smells typically “goaty”, the flavours are sweet with a bit of a salty and tangy. Balance the flavours of the cheese with Chenin blanc, Cidre or wheat beer.    "

The cheese is sprinkled with pepper, herbs or ash for that extra kick in texture and flavour. It is recommended that Chabis de Gatine be consumed when it is semi-dry, i.e. the outer layer should be dry, stained greyish blue and the inner pate should be firm yet at the same time smooth.

However, many countries manufacture cheddar today. Any cheese producing company or artisan manufacturer in any corner of the world can label the cheese produced by them as 'cheddar' since it is not protected like other cheese names or brands.  Cheddar cheese, the most widely purchased and eaten cheese globally, is always made from cow's milk. It is a hard cheese with a slightly crumbly texture if properly cured, and if it is too young, the texture is smooth. It gets a sharper taste as it matures, over a period of time between 9 to 24 months. It is shaped like a drum, and its colour generally ranges from white to pale yellow. However, some cheddars are orange, if colourings such as annatto are added."

They display the same firmness as cheese but with an added springy or rubbery texture. Most varieties are naturally uncoloured, as it doesn’t require artificial colouring. Fresh Cheese curds are eaten as snack, appetizer or served with an additional flavour such as jalapeño peppers, garlic, various herbs, and spice blends such as Cajun. Fried Cheese curds are a popular local delicacy in Wisconsin and eastern Minnesota where they are deeply fried covered in batter and served with a side of ranch dressing as quick, casual fast food. They are also known as cheeseballs in some areas. Cheese curds form the main ingredient in Poutine, a Canadian dish made with French fries, topped with a light brown gravy-like sauce and Cheese Curds.

Reputed to have been made since Roman times, the cheese is also mentioned in the Domesday Book of the 11th century. Dense and crumbly, Cheshire is made using vegetarian rennet and pasteurised cow’s milk. The taste and flavour of cheese develop with ripening. Young Cheshire is firm, crumbly and white in colour. It is mild, milky and aromatic leaving behind a slightly tangy aftertaste on the palette. Sometimes, to add a different dimension to the cheese, annatto is added to the milk, which gives Red Cheshire a deep shade of red-orange. However, there is no difference in the flavour and texture in both cousins. Another variant is a Blue Cheshire ripened with Penicillium culture moulds. An aged Cheshire becomes firmer and darkens considerably. It is now a full-flavoured cheese yet with no hint of bitterness. Though still crumbly, the cheese turns dry with maturity. Cheshire with its lower salt content makes for a perfect crumble on fruits, chutney, and vegetable and baked dishes."

They are popular among the elderly and children, who are more likely to show low tolerance to cow’s milk. Also, goat cheeses are lower in fat and higher in vitamin A and potassium. They serve as a perfect substitute for many dieters. A majority of goat cheeses come from France, the most famous among them being Bucheron, Chabis and Crottin de Chavignol. Goat cheeses have a unique, tart, earthy flavour that sets them apart from cow milk cheeses. This distinctive tang and aroma of the cheese become stronger as it ages. Milk production of goats, unlike cows, is seasonal from mid-March through October. Only a few kinds of cheese are aged beyond four months, and they cannot be frozen without loss of quality. Considering the availability of limited milk production, experiments are on to make cheeses from frozen goat milk curd. Goat cheeses come in many sizes and shapes, such as round patties, log-shapes, drum-shaped, pyramids, round loaves, long loaves etc. Chevres are excellent dessert cheeses, often served as snacks or drinks."

The cheese should be a mix of the raw milk of one herd of goats. Produced only a farmstead, milk should come from a herd containing 80% Alpine breed goats. To guarantee the authenticity of the produce and AOC stamp, the diameter of each cheese cylinder must measure 9 to 12cm and a length of 3 to 4.5cm. It should contain 45% fat and weigh between 250 to 350 grams. Chevrotin des Aravis is a washed rind cheese made similar to a Reblochon, except with goat’s milk. The maturation which lasts for 3-4 weeks results in a fine and smooth paste and a yellowish-orange rind that is moist and tainted with moulds. As with other chevre cheese, it has the odor of goats and flowers with a nearly sweet taste. Being a mountain cheese, it has an inherited aromatic sourness suggestive of wild herbs fed to the goats. Chevrotin des Aravis pairs well with Cotes du Rhone, Bandol, Mondeuse, Chignin-bergeron, Saint-joseph and Savoie wines."

Chhurpi is made by separating whey from buttermilk solids to produce curds similar to Italian Ricotta. Fresh curds are white, soft and neutral to taste but they are left to ferment to acquire a bit of tanginess. Soft Durkha or Chhurpi is an excellent source of protein and used as a substitute for vegetables in the mountainous region. A curry and/or pickle are made of Chhurpi and is eaten with rice as a staple food in everyday meals. Chhur singba or Chhur mingba is freshly prepared Chhurpi prepared by adding the extract of crab apple fruits (thung). Hard Durkha or Chhurpi is made out of yak milk. After the curds are cured at room temperature for 2-3 days, the cheese is sliced and left to dry in the sun or dried in the oven on low heat. This type of Chhurpi becomes very hard and lasts many years. If hard Chhurpi is as old as 4 to 5 years, it is called chhurpupu. If stored properly in yak skin (mongnang), hard Chhurpi can be consumed even for 20 years."

Due to the US dairy regulations, Colby cheese is made from cow's milk and is available at grocery stores all over the US. The cheese was developed in 1874 by Joseph Steinwand at his cheese factory near Colby, Wisconsin. Though Colby cheese looks similar to cheddar due to its colour, Colby cheese is softer, milder, creamy and has a more open texture. It does not undergo the 'cheddaring' process but is manufactured with a washed curd process that reduces the acid content. An aged Colby becomes cracked and dry, so it is advisable to eat when young.  Colby's gentle flavour and texture give a new definition to grilled sandwiches, hamburgers, fajitas, rye bread or apples and pears. It is sometimes blended with other cheeses, such as Monterey Jack, to make Colby Jack cheese."

This hard mountain cheese is matured to perfection in the silence and darkness of special caves where the cheese gets its unique taste, texture and colour. There are several maturing cellars in the region where Comté is ripened for a minimum of 4 months to 18 or 24 months. A few times, Comté gets its name from the cellar where it has ripened such as Comté Fort Saint-Antoine. Comté was one of the first few kinds of cheese to receive an AOC (Appellation d'origine controlee) status in 1958. It is one of the most popular AOC cheeses in France with around 40,000 tonnes of annual production. Considered one of the finest cheeses in the world, a wedge of Comte reveals a pale yellow interior and a texture that can vary from silky, flabby to crystalline. There are practically 83 flavours, which can be savoured while tasting Comté. But the main aromatic flavours that delicately linger on the palate are a balance of brown-butter and roasted-nut aromas and a sweet finish. Its ability to melt easily means Comté goes well with many recipes right from fondues to Croque Monsieur. The cheese pairs well with Rhone reds, a Palo Cortado or off-dry Amontillado sherry from Spain. Fromageries Arnaud, the winner of Super Gold medal at the 2014 World Cheese Awards, is one of the top-notch groups in the world to make French certified-origin cheeses. Today, the Fromagerie counts for roughly 12% of the total Comté production. The cheese is distributed worldwide by British supplier Anthony Rowcliffe & Son. This celebrated cheese has been judged as one of the world's 62 best cheeses.In addition, Comte produced by Entremont also won a silver medal for its great taste and impeccable texture. Entremont makes Comte in three varieties – 1 year matured Prestige, fruity flavoured Fruité and Vieille Reserve made using traditional methods in 50 small village cheese dairies."

Made from cow's milk, 16 liters of immaculated fresh milk from the selected area are required to produce just one kilo of this amazing cheese. Protected with DOP law, it becomes an extraordinary by its content of vitamins and proteins and also by its calcium and phosphorus rich nature. After the maturation period of natural ageing, its paste offers an extraordinary healthful power with soft and velveteen nature. This cheese is known as \"new\" when it has passed the current year, said to be \"mature\" when it has completed a period of 12 - 18 months. It is called as \"old\" when it reaches a period of 18 - 24 months and \"ultra old\" when it is aged for 24 - 36 months. The quality of each and every cheese is examined by eight factors namely age, maturing degree, fragrance, structure, paste colour, consistency, rind condition and dappling. The shape of cheese is checked by the \"threshing\" and \"dowelling\" processes with the help of specific tools such as the percussion hammer, the screw needle, the plug or probe. The colour of cheese goes from golden straw to pale straw, equally spread over the cheese shape. This typical cheese goes well with Champagne or with the best Italian red wines such as Brunello and Barolo.  Two varieties of Cravero Parmigiano Reggiano: Cravero Parmigiano Reggiano San Pietro - A cheese produced by San Pietro is aged for a year at their farm, then transferred to Cravero family for further aging. Fully aged cheese is deep-savoury, brothy-flavoured with bass notes. Cravero Parmigiano Reggiano Baruffi - A cheese produced by Baruffi is aged for a year at their farm, then transferred to Cravero family for further aging. Fully aged cheese is creamy, smooth with sweet, fruity, aromatic flavour and mouthwatering high notes."

In German, it is also called Doppelrhamstufel meaning cheese made with \"double cream\". The cheese has a mildly lactic aroma and a slightly salty taste. Cream cheese is firmed with the use of lactic acid and so needs to be consumed fresh. It has a relatively short life even when refrigerated. Cream cheeses made using traditional methods tend to be more crumbly than spreadable while those with stabilizers like guar gum are more firm. The taste, texture and production are similar to Boursin and Mascarpone. Cream cheese is suitable for vegetarians since it uses acid, such as citric acid to coagulate the milk. Cream cheese has a mild, sweet taste with a pleasant slight tang. It is a smooth, spreadable cheese at room temperature and comes in various flavoured varieties including those with herbs, fruits blended in. The cheese is widely consumed in United States where it used to enrich cheesecakes, frostings, dips, toppings, sweet & savory dishes and desserts. It is also used to make flavourful desserts with colourful fruit combinations such as blueberries, raspeberries and kiwis."

It is one of those rarest cheeses that can be eaten at various stages of its maturity. It is often clothed in fine herbs when fresh from the cheese vat. At this stage of the maturing process, it has a creamy, nutty taste. After about six weeks, while its smell starts getting more robust, its pate becomes dry and brittle. Moreover, a more rigid texture with a pronounced flavour starts to develop. Hereafter, the cheese continues to mature, and the robust taste increases but never gets sour. Its rind develops into a rough and hard layer over a period of time."

The smell of Danbo is mild, slightly acidic, and aromatic due to smear ripening. Its unique taste and texture are achieved after maturing for about 3-4 weeks. The fat percent in Danbo varies from 15 to 45%.  It is a rectangular cheese with a smooth, dry rind, and sometimes it is covered in red wax. Flavourings such as caraway seeds add a new dimension to the taste of Danbo. When caraway seeds are added to the cheese, it is known as \"King Christian\" cheese, named after King Christian IX, who ruled Denmark during the late 19th and early 20th centuries."

Derby is a semi-hard cheese made from cow's milk with a mild flavour and creamy ivory to a rich yellow pate. It is sometimes compared to mild cheddar because of the texture, but Derby is milder with a buttery, creamy flavour and strong melting ability. Only a few farms in England make Derby cheese the time-honoured way. Traditional Derby matured for nine months has an open texture with a smooth, creamy body and a nutty flavour. Due to its melting characteristics, it is used in many dishes. It goes well with fresh fruits and Chenin Blanc or Sauvignon Blanc.  "

The cheese, made from the milk of once nearly extinct Old Gloucester cows, traces its origins to 1498 in the City of Gloucester. Gloucester comes in both single and double varieties. While Single Gloucester is made from skimmed milk, Double Gloucester uses full fat milk. In addition, Double Gloucester is twice the height of Single Gloucester and more flavourful. It is also said that Double Gloucester uses the whole milk taken from two milking or a mixture of milk and cream. The double variety has a smooth and buttery texture, rich and nutty yet mellow flavour and apricot colour thanks to the addition of annatto plant extract. Vegetarian rennet is used and the cheese is aged for at least 4 months. If the cheese is allowed to age further, it will develop more complex and nutty flavours. Moreover, the texture tends to become very hard and flaky. Double Gloucester participates every year in the Cooper's Hill Cheese-Rolling and Wake where buyers jump on the cheese to evaluate its quality and sustainability. A traditional British Ale or red like Syrah will perfectly complement a Double Gloucester. Double Gloucester A has won many international awards including Silver medal at 2014 World Cheese Awards."

It is named after a commune in the Hautes-Pyrénées department in south-western France. The cheese, made from the milk of sheep, traces its history to the seventeenth century when it was first made in the high mountains of Aquitaine-Pyrenees. This uncooked, pressed cheese is washed with saltwater brine and matured at least two to six months in cool and damp cellars. After four months, the washed rind thickens and becomes yellowish while the paste is soft yet firm. It has the characteristic strong smell of sheep's cheeses with a pronounced fruity and nutty flavour. The best Esbareich is found during summer and autumn. Pair the cheese with a red wine like Madiran."

Said to be one of the top stinky cheeses in the world, Esrom indeed has a flavour that is quite rich, strong and aromatic. With ageing, the flavour and aroma get even stronger and spicier. It is made in flat, rectangular shapes wrapped in foil. Open the cheese to reveal a yellow pate with a supple texture and uneven holes. The bold flavours of the cheese go well with dark beers and red wines. It also tastes good when added to casseroles or sandwiches."

It takes six gallons of ewe’s milk to produce one wheel of Etorki. Cheesemaking in the Pyrenees region has been following a tradition that has remained unchanged for the last 4000 years. It requires the cheese to be pressed but not cooked and slowly matured for a period of three to six months. Etorki has a rusty, bumpy rind because of the molds formed during pressing. The smooth, supple and velvety interior is white with occasional holes or slits. It has a sweet and earthy aroma suggestive of the caramel flavours released by the pressed and aged sheep’s milk. Pair Etorki with chardonnay, riojas or traditional, sparkling white wines."

The art of making the cheese was passed by the monks to the farmer’s wives who produced a blue variety of Wensleydale at their farmhouses. Today, Wensleydale is produced mainly from pasteurised cow’s milk with sheep’s milk added to enhance the flavour. Wensleydale Creamery in the town of Hawes is seeking to protect the name Yorkshire Wensleydale Cheese under PDO designation. But there are other producers of Wenslydale cheese in parts of the UK, mainly in Shropshire and Cheshire. Extra Mature Wensleydale, matured for nine months is the strongest Wensleydale produced by Wensleydale Creamery. It is placed on shelves in the atmospherically - controlled maturing room. Wensleydale goes well with fruit cake, apple and is a perfect accompaniment during lunchtime or tea time. It also tastes delicious with hot desserts like fruit pies and crumbles. It is the king of cheeseboard where its fresh, milky sweetness and robust flavours rule the roost. It complements fruity white wine such as Pinot Grigio."

        "decription": "Feta is undoubtedly one of the most famous Greek cheeses. In fact, Feta occupies 70% stake in Greek cheese consumption. The cheese is protected by EU legislation and only those cheeses manufactured in Macedonia, Thrace, Thessaly, Central Mainland Greece, the Peloponnese, Lesvos and Island of Kefalonia can be called ‘feta’. Similar cheeses produced elsewhere in the eastern Mediterranean and around the Black Sea, outside the EU, are often called ‘white cheese’. To create traditional feta, 30 percent of goat's milk is mixed with sheep's milk of animals grazing on pastures in the specific appellation of origin regions. Nowadays, many stores sell goat and cow’s milk feta as well. The firmness, texture and flavour differ from region to region, but in general, cheese from Macedonia and Thrace is mild, softer and creamier, less salty with fewer holes. Feta made in Thessaly and Central Greece has a more intense, robust flavour. Peloponnese feta is dryer in texture, full flavoured and more open. Local environment, animal breeds, cultures all have an impact on the texture, flavour and aroma of feta. On the whole, Feta is a pickled curd cheese that has a salty and tangy taste enhanced by the brine solution. The texture depends on the age which can be extremely creamy, or crumbly dry. Upon maturation of 2 months, feta is sold in blocks submerged in the brine. The cheese can be used a table cheese or melted on a traditional Greek salad, spanakopita, pizza or pie. It tastes delicious with olive oil, roasted red peppers and nuts. If required, it can be washed under water to remove the extra saltiness. The salty flavour of Feta pairs well with beer, Pinot Noir, Sauvignon Blanc and Zinfandel."

Soft in texture, the milk is sourced from a herd of Friesland-Dorset sheep. It is matured for a minimum of three weeks at the end of which the square molds develop a bloomy, pinkish rind. The paste is ivory white in colour, resembling a whipped ice cream. This aromatic cheese is mushroomy, sweet and slightly citrusy in flavour. As it ages, Flower Marie develops more intense flavours but also softens down."

Its name comes from the town of Montbrison in the Loire department. It is made from unpasteurised milk of Montbéliardes cows and has the shape of a tall cylinder block.The cheese with a distinctive, punctured orange-brown rind has a creamy coloured pate dotted with veins of blue moulds derived from Penicillium Roqueforti culture. It smells musty and woody due to the ageing on spruce boards. The flavour is milky with a hint of woodiness and frankly, too mild for a blue cheese. Cheese connoisseurs who are ready to experiment with blue cheeses could start with Fourme de Montbrison. The cheese received its French AOC status in 1972 along with Fourme d'Ambert Cheese. In 2002, the two cheeses received their own separate AOC status realizing the difference in the manufacturing process."

Fresh mozzarella balls are sold in a brine, whey or water solution to help them retain their moisture and shape. This cheese has a soft, moist texture and is full of milky flavour. Similar to other fresh cheeses, mozzarella fresco is high in water content and therefore low in fat. It has a slightly acidic or lactic taste. Compared to mass-processed mozzarellas, the freshly made variant is creamier and much softer. True buffalo mozzarella is highly appreciated around the world than the one made with cow’s milk. Fresh mozzarella’s firmer texture has gained popularity as a slicing cheese on pizzas or flatbreads, snacks, salads or vegetables. It pairs well with fresh tomatoes, pestos, fruits, olives, basil and tapenades. Try the cheese with cava or other sparkling wines. This cheese is available in curd form to pull your own fresh mozzarella by hand, logs or shape of balls called Bocconcini. These days fresh mozzarella is available in most supermarkets and Italian stores. Let the cheese soak in the brine solution until ready to consume and eat it within 2-3 days. Consuming fresh is recommended as it becomes bitter and sour with age."

Many times, the term Fromage Frais is used interchangeably with Fromage Blanc, but according to the French legislation - \"The denomination fromage frais is reserved for unripened cheese that underwent a mostly lactic fermentation. Fermented white cheese marketed under the terms fresh or fresh cheese must contain live flora at the time of sale to the consumer.\" In simple language, Fromage Frais must contain live cultures when sold. The cheese in its original form is very bland to taste and extremely low in fat. Savoury spices, sweet berries and cream are added to improve the flavour, which also increases the fat content, sometimes as much as 8%. The cheese is used as a savoury appetizer or a creamy dessert by combining it with herbs, fruits and spices. Fromage Frais with a loose consistency, ranging between heavy and sour cream, is often used to thicken and richen sauces. It is a traditional accompaniment to caviar since the milky goodness of the cheese reduces the saltiness of the eggs. Fresh, creamy cheese like Fromage Frais pairs well with sparkling white wine, Zinfandel and fortified wines."

Any recipe that requires the use of Monterey Jack could be replaced with Fynbo. However, Fynbo is very difficult to find outside Denmark such as the United States.

The cheese, made from the milk of once nearly extinct Old Gloucester cows, traces its origins to 1498 in the City of Gloucester.Gloucester comes in two varieties. Single Gloucester is made from skimmed milk and Double Gloucester uses full-fat milk. In addition, Double Gloucester is twice the height of Single Gloucester and more flavourful. It is also said that Double Gloucester uses whole milk taken from two milkings or a mixture of milk and cream. On the other hand, Single Gloucester uses whole cream milk from the morning milking and skimmed milk from the evening milking. Single Gloucester has a P.D.O designation, meaning it is produced only in Gloucestershire. It is matured for less time and thus develops a fresh, somewhat nutty taste but is slightly more acidic than Double. Also, it is lighter in texture, crumbly and low in fat.Double Gloucester has a smooth buttery texture, rich and nutty yet mellow flavour and apricot colour due to the addition of annatto plant extract. Vegetarian rennet is used, and the cheese is aged for at least four months. The cheese develops more complex and nutty flavours if it is aged further. Moreover, the texture tends to become very hard and flaky. Double Gloucester participates every year in Cooper's Hill Cheese-Rolling and Wake, where buyers jump on the cheese to evaluate its quality and sustainability. A traditional British Ale or red like Syrah perfectly complements a Double Gloucester."

If truth be told, it is one of the most popular cheeses in the world, accounting for 50 to 60% of the world's cheese consumption. It is a semi-hard cheese celebrated for its rich, unique flavour and smooth texture. The original cheese markets in Gouda is one of the last standing commercial cheese markets in the Netherlands. Since the name is not protected, it has become a generic classification for all cheeses produced and sold under the name Gouda. Gouda is typically made from pasteurised cow’s milk although some artisan varieties use sheep’s or goat’s milk to produce cheeses that are going to be aged for a long time. Boerenkaas is a typical variety of unpasteurised Gouda cheese produced by the farmers from the milk of cow's grazing on the natural, low pastures of Netherlands. There are seven different types of Gouda cheese, categorized depending on age. Graskaas is young Gouda ready to be consumed within weeks of production. On the other hand, is the extra aged, Overjarig cheese which has a full-flavoured, hard, golden interior and salty flavour reminiscent of toffee. Between the spectrums is a variety of Dutch Gouda’s classified as per the texture and age - Jong, Jong belegen, Belegen, Extra belegen, and Oud. Each cheese gets increasingly firmer in texture and richer in flavour than earlier classification. The waxed rind of the cheese also changes by the age as soft, younger Dutch Gouda cheese are identified by yellow, orange, or red wax rinds white mature cheese have black wax coverings. Stacked Gouda WheelsIn America, smoother and less flavourful commercial Gouda is popular than Dutch Gouda. Artisans in the Netherlands may produce Dutch Gouda using raw milk as well as pasteurised.  To enhance the flavour of the cheese, herbs, seasonings, and nuts may be blended. In the Netherlands, aged Gouda is commonly used to richen soups, sauces. Young Goudas are best paired with beer while medium cheeses taste best when paired with a fruity Riesling or Chenin Blanc. A well-aged Gouda complements wines that are deeply flavoured such as a rich Merlot or Shiraz. Gouda cheese may be grated, sliced, cubed or melted. It may be used as a table cheese or dessert cheese. Gouda is available in large wheels with each weighing between 10 and 25 pounds."

However, in Europe, the word 'Grana' is legally protected by Grana Padano Protected Designation of Origin. Only Grana Padano can use the term to sell its produce in EU countries. The most popular Grana Italian cheeses are of course Parmigiano Reggiano and Grana Padano. True Parmigianino Reggiano, named after the Provinces of Parma, Reggio Emilia, Modena, Bologna and Mantua, where it is produced, has a hard, gritty texture and is fruity and nutty in taste. On the other hand, Grana Padano refers to the valley Pianura Padana where it is made. Though similar to Parmigianino Reggiano, young Grana Padano is slightly less crumbly, milder and less complex than its famous, aged kin. On the other hand, Grana Trentino follows the same method to produce Parmigianino Reggiano but is made in the province of Trento, giving it its name. All three main varieties of Grana cheese carry the label DOP. (Denomination of Protected Origin), guaranteeing their authenticity and origin of production methods."

Created by the Cistercian monks of Chiaravalle in the 12th century, it is still made throughout the Po River Valley in northeastern Italy. The cheese is made from unpasteurised, semi-skimmed cow’s milk from two milkings and generally aged for two years. At the end of the cheese-making process, Grana Padano develops a firm, thick and deeply straw-coloured rind protecting the fragrant, dry, flaking interior. Grana means “grainy” in Italian, which is reflected in the fine granular texture with an intensely sweet flavour. As Grana Padano ages, the flavours become pronounced, savoury and complex, and the texture becomes more crumbly. Though similar to Parmigiano, Reggiano Grana Padano is inexpensive cheese. Moreover, Grana is less crumbly, milder and less complex than its long-aged sibling. Grana Padano is manufactured in cylindrical wheels measuring 35 to 45 cm in diameter and 15 to 18 cm in height. It is sold at different ripening stages: Grana Padano (9 to 16 months), Grana Padano oltre 16 mesi (over 16 months) and Grana Padano Riserva (over 20 months).

Its texture is similar to that of mozzarella or thick feta, except that it has a strong, salty flavour imbibed from the brine preserve. Cooking the Halloumi removes all its saltiness and empowers it with a creamy texture. Since the cheese has a high melting point, it can be easily fried or grilled. Its unusualness lies in the preparation of the cheese where no acid or acid-producing bacterium is required. Halloumi is generally served during the warmer months with watermelon, due to its refreshing qualities. It is an essential part of a Cyprus Meze and many a times it is offered as an accompaniment with cold beer. The cheese also tastes lovely when grilled, pan-fried or thinly sliced on a salad."

Named after the Swedish port city of Vadenost, it is an aged cheese prepared from pasteurised cow’s milk in wheels weighing 14 kilograms each. Herrgardsost has a mild, sweet, nutty, tangy flavour and characteristic small round holes. It is very similar to Gruyere or Cheddar cheese but with a distinctly softer texture. The cheese is aged for 6 months if made with whole milk and 4 months if prepared with skimmed milk. However, to explore the intense attributes of the cheese, Herrgardsost can be aged for up to 12 or even 24 months. It is good table cheese ideal for snacking, melting and crumbling. It is served as a starter with crusty bread or crackers. Enjoy it by melting it on sandwiches or into a salad. Merlot wine is recommended with Herrgardsost to bring out the best from each other."

It is usually shaped into a brick when sold. The flavour is mature and the degree of ripeness weakens towards the centre. When young, Herve is sweet and becomes spicy as it ages. Since it is fully flavoured, it is usually eaten with dark bread and beers. It is one of the most popular cheeses in Belgium."

Since the cheese is not aged, the texture remains soft and it spoils very fast. These days it is very rare to find the cheese commercially because of its neutral taste and short-lived shelf life. It is available in small grocery shops, gas stations and restaurants in the south of the United States where the farmer or grocer sells the cheese fresh off the wheel.Hoop cheese is a mild, slightly salty cheese with a rubbery texture when young which becomes sharp and crumbly if allowed to age. The colour of the pate is rich yellow with a subtle nutty flavour. It is an excellent cooking ingredient that is used to give a creamy texture to the dish without changing the flavour or making it stickier.

It is a difficult cheese to cook with, but visually stunning on a cheese platter. Each cheese could have its own wine pairing, but together they go well with ales and beers."

The texture of the cheese resembles Monterey Jack or a firmer version of the Mozzarella. Hushållsost, a staple on every Swedish farmer’s table, is said to have originated in the 19th century and is closely related to Port Salut. Hushållsost is produced in a drum shape weighing one to two kilograms each. The cheese cylinder is wrapped in a plastic cling before letting it mature for around 60 days. Traditional, Swedish Hushållsost is mild, creamy and brings out flavours of clear salt and fresh acidity. It has a pale, straw-coloured interior with a smooth, open texture and small irregular holes. The low-fat version has a slightly buttery and nutty taste. Use the most popular cheese in Sweden in casseroles, sandwiches and pizza or add it to highlight any buffet or cheese platter.

During this time, the artisanal cheese makers milk the sheep, make the cheese and leave it in the rafters to mature for a minimum of two months. Matured Idiazabal has a hard natural rind, a compact texture, with a few pinprick holes. The rind carries the marks of the wooden moulds in which it was drained. The characteristic, smoky flavour is the result of the cheeses having been stored near the fireplaces. The taste of the cheese is reminiscent of burnt caramel and bacon. The pairs well with red wine and cider.PDO Idiazabal smoked cheese won a Super Gold medal at the 2014 World Cheese Awards. It is declared one of the world's 62 best cheeses. "

Among all its synonyms, leipäjuusto is the more commonly known name. Leipäjuusto is a fresh cheese made from cow's beestings, rich milk from a cow that has recently calved. It can also be made from reindeer or goat milk. The cheese is 'toasted' during its preparation. It contains about 20 to 22% fat, while lighter versions contain about 12% fat. Traditionally, people used to let leipäjuusto get totally dried so that they could store it for several years. For eating, they used to heat the almost rock-hard leipäjuusto cheese on fire to soften it and produce an appetizing aroma. Even today, the cheese is dried by keeping it in a well-ventilated area for a few days. But, unlike its older version, it has a mild flavour."

During this maturation process, white crystals and drops of water are formed from the cheese, known as \"tears of joy\". These \"tears of joy\" are a sign of quality in the cheese. The cave maturation results in a tangly nutty flavour and crumbly texture, typical of the fine Swiss classic from the caves. This genuine classic cheese tastes delicious with dried apricots, dried fruits, caramelized onions and cornichons. Melt it on potatoes au gratin and flatbread.

It is particularly popular in Eastern Europe and the Mediterranean region.Kashkaval made from cow's milk is known as Kashkaval Vitosha while a cheese made from ewe's milk is called Kashkaval Balkan. Kashkaval Preslav is the name given to the cheese made from a mixture of ewe's and cow's milk. In Romania, Bulgaria, and Macedonia, Kashkaval used as a generic term for all kinds of yellow cheeses. This cheese is also found in Hungary, Croatia, and Turkey. The Romanians call this cheese Cascaval, the Greeks Kasseri, while the Turkish prefer to interpret it as Ksara. The cheese is allowed to age for six months, during which it develops a piquant, spicy and somewhat salty taste with a slight hint of olive oil. Due to its similarity in taste with the United Kingdom's Cheddar cheese, it is famously called the \"Cheddar cheese of the Balkans\". Kashkaval belongs to the family of pasta filata cheese that is made by giving the curd a hot bath during the production process. The slightly hard texture of this table cheese makes it suitable for grilling and grating. It is used in salads, appetizers, pizzas, and lasagna."

It is a springy-textured, stringy cheese belonging to the pasta filata family like Provolone or Muenster. The cheese needs to be matured for a minimum of four months to obtain the correct texture and flavour.  This white-crust cheese also competes against another famous Greek cheese, Feta. Kasseri is used as a substitute for mozzarella by many Americans and is preferred by connoisseurs who like full-flavoured cheeses. A bite of Kasseri will enrich your palate with exciting salty flavours and a pungent odour. But interestingly, it soon leaves behind a sweet aftertaste because of the usage of sheep milk. The fat content of this table cheese is between 25% - 45%, and it goes well with omelettes, and sandwiches."

While Labneh is classified as a cheese, it retains the distinctive sour flavour of yoghurt. It forms a traditional and important ingredient of Middle Eastern and south Asian cuisine. The procedure of making Labneh is same as strained yoghurt, that of boiling off some of the water content, adding salt, butterfat and powdered milk. Eaten both cooked and raw, it is used in savoury sauces as it does not curdle at high temperatures, unlike normal yoghurt, due to its high fat content. It is used as dip for bread, added to stew, and to add creaminess to soups. Also used as a sandwich spread. The cheese has to be consumed within a week of its preparation. Nowadays this cheese is also available in low fat variety."

But production reached its peak at the beginning of 20th century, when the monks transferred the recipe to the 'buronniers'. It has been protected by the AOC seal since 1961. Affinage takes at least four months and the temperature of affinage and conservation must be below 140C.Laguiole has a thick, greyish-orange and natural rind beneath which lies a straw-coloured supple and firm pate. The rich and creamy texture of the pate right away melts away in the mouth unveiling a sharp and yet slightly sour flavour. An aromatic cheese, Laguiole is great as a table cheese and one of the principal ingredients in Aligot – a traditional mashed potato French dish."

However, locals also produce versions of cheese from cow’s and goat’s milk. One such cheese made from unpasteurised ewe’s milk is semi-cooked and pressed, sculpted in the shape of flattened round loaf. It is packaged in a cylinder weighing 5 to 6 kilograms and measuring 30 cm in diameter and 9 cm thick. The crust of this cheese is smooth, straw coloured while the paste is supple dough. At 6 months of ripening, the texture of the cheese becomes hard and brittle. When young, the cheese has a sweet, smoky, mild and nutty taste which becomes pronounced and intense with age. The affinage of six months gives the cheese a balanced blend of acidity, salt and fat. It is used as a table cheese, but when aged, it is also good for cooking."

After maturing for at least 60 days, it develops a waxy yellow rind and the imprints of esparto grass in which it is moulded. The flavour graph varies according to its age, ranging from buttery when it is young and bitter when it is mature. During maturing, the cheese turns into a deliciously runny and almost liquidy paste. A fully matured La Serena has a creamy consistency that can be scooped out after cutting out the circular lid. The intense bitter yet pleasant flavour tastes best with bread or toast. "

The interior of the cheese is butter coloured, with small pinholes in the semi-soft, creamy paste. It has a fresh flavour and nutty aftertaste, with lingering flavours of butter and grass."

This Dutch cheese is produced in factories and traditionally on farms in the historic area of Leiden (Leyden).The addition of cumin seeds gives the cheese a distinctive dry, tangy and spicy flavour, very unlike other Dutch cheeses. Cloves and Caraway seeds are also added occasionally for that extra boost. The wax-coated Leyden is a perfect addition to any cheese platter.

The aroma is clean and mild with hints of butterscotch.

Artisanal cheese makers prepare this cheese from pasteurised cow’s milk sourced from local, organic farms. As a result, the flavour of the cheese is mild despite the stinky aroma. The exterior of the cheese is covered with a thin pale, orange-brown rind, an effect of regular washings. In the first month, Limburger is firm and crumbly and becomes chalky and soft at the end of six weeks. After two months, the cheese is much smoother and creamy. After three months, Limburger acquires the infamous aroma due to smear-ripening bacterium. This cheese has a significant grassy and mushroomy taste underlined by a delicate tang at the end. Limburger goes well with Belgian style ales and icy cold bock beer. It tastes best when it is served between two slices of dark rye bread and a slice of onion."

The cheese was invented by Simon Jones from Lincolnshire, who decided to turn the spring milk from his herd of Holsteins into cheese. Traditional Lincolnshire Poacher is available in a cylindrical shape, coated by a rind appearing similar to granite. It is a slow-maturing cheese that takes between 12-24 months to develop a golden, straw-coloured yellow pate and spotted brown and grey colour rind. One gets daily, and seasonal variation in terms of both flavour and texture but all-in-all the cheese has both cheddar and gruyere-like qualities. It has a smooth texture and a strong taste. In summer, notes of pineapple, toasted nuts and grassy dominate the flavour profile while in winter, the taste becomes savoury and almost meaty. Lincolnshire Poacher pairs well with full-bodied reds and whites and beer. The company makes many other traditional kinds of cheese such as Vintage Lincolnshire Poacher aged for 18 to 22 months, Smoked Lincolnshire Poacher, Double Barrel, and Lincolnshire Red, made using vegetarian rennet."

Originating in the commune of Livarot and protected by AOC since 1975, the cheese is also called \"The Colonel\" because of the five strips of raffia that encircle the cheese, similar to the one worn on a French army colonel's uniform.Livarot is considered to be one of the finest cheeses by aficionados who love its soft, golden paste with little holes and springy texture. The taste is nutty, melting in the mouth to release the flavours of a salty lemon and spiciness. The texture is creamy, smooth and quite runny at room temperature. Each wheel is washed in brine, coloured in annatto and matured for up to two months in warm, humid cellars to develop the delicious taste.Livarot is best enjoyed with a full-bodied red wine, a glass of Calvados, Normandy cider or even a traditional French hard cider. It tastes excellent with crusty bread and fruits or added to vegetables, fruit salads, soups and gratins."

The aging process takes six to eight months during which the cheeses are rubbed and turned every other day to create a light grey rind. Underneath is a golden yellow paste that deepens as it gets closer to the rind. The texture is dry and a bit grainy with flavour of roasted hazelnuts and salty caramel, along with fresh grassy notes. Lord of the Hundred's sweet and savory flavour pairs very good with medium-bodied Pinot-Noir or Cream Ale as a beer selection. This cheese can be used as a substitute to Parmigiano-Reggiano.

The cheese was created in the early 1990s as an alternative to more expensive Swiss Emmental cheese. It is a high-fat cheese with a minimum of 45% fat. Although similar to Emmental, the moisture content in Maasdam is more, making it suppler. Nearly 15% of Dutch cheese production is made up of Maasdam. It ripens faster than other Dutch cheeses, being ready in four to 12 weeks. The outside shell of the cheese has a smooth, yellow rind. Sometimes, the rind is waxed like Gouda. Inside the pate is a semi-firm, pale yellow with big eyes. It has a creamy texture and a sweet, buttery, nutty taste with a fruity background. If eaten young, it tastes delectable with a sandwich or as a snack. Satiate your taste buds by melting the cheese on casseroles, soups or fondues. Maasdam cheese has all of the traits of Leerdammer cheese except for the brand name, which resides exclusively with Le Groupe Bel. It pairs well with White Zinfandel, Lager, Pale Ale, Gewurztraminer, Chardonnay, Merlot, Sauvignon Blanc and Chianti."

Depending on the season, the cheese can also be made from cow’s milk or a combination of goat's and cow's milk. The full fat cheese, which gained AOC certification in 2005, is shaped to resemble a truncated cone. It is soft, cream coloured, firm, creamy and smooth with a melt-in-the-mouth consistency. As it ripens, marks of blue penicillium may start to envelop the cheese, turning it from ivory to bluish. Mâconnais gives away a light herbal, salty flavour and smell. The longer the maturation process, the harder and saltier, Mâconnais will become. The cheese perfectly goes with a glass of Chablis, Macon Red or a Beaujolais, Wheat beer, crackers and fruit."

It is also said that the cheese has been created in the 10th century by a monk, Maroilles in northern France. While preparing Maroilles, the industrialized version uses pasteurised milk as opposed to the artisan cheese which is still depends on raw milk. It usually has a square shape with brick-red, smooth, washed and sticky rind. When young, the cheese is called “Maroille Blanc” because the cheese has still not developed the distinctive brick red rind and characteristic flavour. It is matured from five weeks to four months during which it is regularly washed with salt and water. If eaten young, the cheese is still chalky in the center and has a bitter rind. As it ages and with the washing process, the rind changes its colour from yellow to orange and finally red. At four months, the ivory pâte is soft and oily. It has a powerful, pungent aroma suggestive of fermenting fruit and the flavour reminds of smoky bacon. Earthy notes of walnuts and mushrooms contrasted by a strong, pungent aroma are very typical of an aged Maroilles. This cheese is produced in various sizes and the content of fat is about 29 per cent."

The texture of Mascarpone ranges from smooth, creamy to buttery, depending on how it is processed during cheesemaking. The concise portrayal of Mascarpone really is just thickened cream that is on its way to becoming butter. Making cheese is so simple that many people easily make Mascarpone at home. Mascarpone is used in both sweet and savoury dishes. It is added to enhance the flavour of the dish without overwhelming the original taste. The cheese tastes best with anchovies, mustard and spices or mixed with cocoa or coffee. Tiramisu, a layered dish with espresso, brandy, chocolate, and Mascarpone has brought cheese to the forefront of Italian cooking. Another possible use of Mascarpone is to thicken puddings and dessert creams. It is also popular as a standalone dessert served with fruit or syrup. Whether you buy Mascarpone or make it at home, it needs to be consumed within a few days, or it can go bad. "

These monks continued to make the cheese until the dissolution of their monasteries in 1540. Traditionally, sheep’s milk was used, but over the time cow’s milk was also used. The art of making the cheese was passed by the monks to the farmer’s wives who produced a blue variety of Wensleydale at their farmhouses. Today, Wensleydale is produced mainly from pasteurised cow’s milk with sheep’s milk added to enhance the flavour. Wensleydale Creamery in the town of Hawes is seeking to protect the name Yorkshire Wensleydale Cheese under PDO designation. But there are other producers of Wenslydale cheese in parts of the UK, mainly in Shropshire and Cheshire. Mature Wensleydale is a harder, flavoured variant of Wensleydale produced by Wensleydale Creamery. Wensleydale goes well with fruit cake, apple and is a perfect accompaniment during lunchtime or tea time. It also tastes delicious with hot desserts like fruit pies and crumbles. It is the king of cheeseboard where its fresh, milky sweetness and robust flavours rule the roost. It complements fruity white wine such as Pinot Grigio."

Maytag Blue cheese is ripened over six months during which it develops a dense, crumbly texture and semi-sharp flavour. Every bite of Maytag melts in the mouth releasing a slightly tangy flavour with a lemony finish. With its pungent odour, the cheese might not suit everyone’s tastes. The cheese delivered in decorative silver foil tastes delectable when crumbled into salads, crackers or melted onto a burger. Also, try it with a glass of ale or lager.

It is a soft, wet cheese made from raw cow milk and can be ripened or unripened depending on its variation. The tradition of making Minas cheese is more than 300 years old. In May 2008, the original firm, ripened Minas cheese was declared a Brazilian Immaterial Cultural Heritage by IPHAN, the Brazilian Immaterial Cultural Heritage by IPHAN, the Brazilian Institute for National Historic and Artistic Heritage. The time left to ripen Minas cheese can vary from as little as 4 -10 days, which results in queijos-de-minas frescal cheese. It has a spongy texture, with lots of air bubbles inside with a mild yet quite salty taste. The saltiness will vary according to the region and producer. This is not a good cooking cheese but can be used to make sandwiches, pastries and crêpes. The texture tends to become slightly rubbery rather than stringy with heat. It pairs well with turkey breast and other low fat cold cuts, cooked strong-tasting vegetables and salads. If left to mature for around 1-5 weeks, the soft unripened variety develops into partly-cured Minas cheese (queijo minas meia-cura). The fully-cured variety of Minas cheese called queijo minas curado is ready when juicy softness has evaporated and it acquires a yellowish tint. Curado cheese has a white core, pricked with tiny bubbles of air, slightly more granulated than frescal and with a more stronger taste, deviating to bitter. It is excellent for cooking, being used in a huge variety of dishes, particularly the famous pão de queijo (cheese bun). One of the most popular desserts in Brazil is a sweet dish called goiabada prepared with Minas cheese and guavas. A branded, supermarket variety called Queijo Padrao is also popular across Brazil. It is similar to frescal, except that it is less soft, juicy and salty than the original."

The cheese became popular by the name “Monterey Jack's” or “Jack's Monterey,” eventually acquiring the name Monterey Jack. Monterey Jack is commonly used in Mexican and Spanish cuisine because it is mild in flavour and melts really well. It is similar in taste and texture to Colby and Cheddar. Variants of Monterey Jack, known as Dry Jack (aged version) and Pepper Jack (pepper spiced), are also quite popular. Monterey Jack is available across all grocery stores and supermarkets in the United States. Consider Pinot Noir and Riesling with this cheese."

The farm uses milk only from Montgomery's own herd of 200 Friesian cows. The cheese is prepared in a variety of flavours, ageing periods and sizes. Most cheeses are matured for 12 months in muslin cloth on wooden shelves, while some, like Extra Mature Cheddar, are aged for 18 months to deliver that special texture and flavour. With ageing, the texture becomes drier.Montgomery's Mature Cheddar reveals deep, rich, nutty flavours, while Montgomery's Extra Mature Cheddar brings a nuttier, spicier and peppery flavour to the palate. Montgomery's Smoked Cheddar is oak-smoked for six hours to give an intense smokey flavour and aroma, which complements the nutty flavour of the cheese.  The Cheddar can be eaten cooked, grated or eaten on its own. However, it makes its mark when added to the cheeseboard."

The unique combination of earthy, lemony and mould flavours of the leaf become intense as the cheese matures. On the surface, the rind of the cheese is delicate and wrinkled with blue and green mould underneath the leaf shell.

It can be kept in brine for up to a week. Low-moisture mozzarella can be refrigerated for a month; some shredded low-moisture mozzarella's shelf life is up to six months.  Since 1996, mozzarella is recognised as a Traditional Specialty Guaranteed (TSG/STG) food product in the EU. It is available in the form of balls of different sizes. Fresh mozzarella is one of those easy-to-make-at-home cheeses used in salads, meats, seafood, and vegetables. Mozzarella di Bufala, also known as 'buffalo mozzarella', is made from domesticated water buffalo milk. Mozzarella Fior di Latte is produced from fresh, pasteurised or unpasteurised cow milk, while low-moisture mozzarella is made from whole or partly skimmed milk. And last, but not least, mozzarella affumicata is a smoked variety of mozzarella. Ciliegine is a traditional Italian type of mozzarella made with pasteurized cow's milk or sometimes with water buffalo's milk, and is available in small smooth white balls. Mozzarella made from sheep's milk by adding lamb rennet, is called mozzarella pecorella or mozzapecora, in Sardinia, Abruzzo, and Lazio. Mozzarella is also produced from goat's milk."

Mozzarella has a mild, slightly sweet taste and generally is moist due to the brine solution. However, the loaf, aged and commercial varieties are drier and have a milder flavour. Because of its excellent melting properties, the cheese blends well with baked dishes, sandwiches and pasta."

It has been observed that the cheeses made from buffalo milk are higher in calcium, protein and lower in cholesterol than cow's milk. The cheese is manufactured under strict regulations in areas ranging from Rome in Lazio to Paestum, Campania and a production area near Foggia, Puglia. Buffalo mozzarella from the Campania region bears the \"Mozzarella di Bufala Campana\" trademark and DOC status granted in 1993. In 2008, the European Union granted Mozzarella di Bufala Campana a Protected Geographical Status. Apart from Italy, it is also produced in many countries. Buffalo mozzarella is a fresh, soft, semi-elastic textured cheese belonging to the \"pasta filata\" family. The process of making pasta filata cheese includes heating the curd to a point where it can be stretched and formed into various shapes. This gives the snowy white mozzarella a mild yet slightly sour taste. The texture is soft, moist and somewhat granular. It is coated with a thin edible rind and brined for up to a week when sold in vacuum-sealed packages. The cheese goes well in antipasti dishes, salads, pastas, calzones, vegetables and various side dishes. It is also common in popular Italian dishes like lasagne and baked casserole. When used in cooking, heated mozzarella becomes slightly creamy. Buffalo mozzarella pairs with Beaujolais, Sauvignon Blanc and White.  "

Also, it is sold younger than its counterpart.Because of its excellent melting properties, it is used in grilled dishes such as sandwiches, macaroni and cheese, pizza and cheeseburgers.

The name Munster is derived from the little town of Munster where Vosgian abbeys and monasteries used to make this cheese since the Middle Ages. Traditional Munster is protected by an Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée (AOC) which requires the cheese be made from unpasteurised cow's milk called crude milk. The soft and creamy cheese also comes flavoured with cumin and tastes best when accompanied with a good beer. As with washed rind cheeses, Munster have a red coating on the rind that is slightly humid due to repeated washings. Other than protecting the cheese, the rind is also responsible for a strong, penetrating aroma and tangy taste. The best Munster cheeses are produced in the summer and autumn when the cows graze on the 'high stubble' of the Vosges. This cheese has a very high fat content of 45-50%. Gewurztraminer or full-bodied red wines nicely complement Munster. If you're a potato and cheese lover try Munster with potatoes, salad and finely chopped onions."

It has been made in Greece for thousands of years and is believed to be the ancestor of all Greek whey cheeses. There are two forms of Mizythra, fresh and dried. In Cyprus, similar cheese is known as Anari. Fresh Mizythra is unsalted and consumed within a few days. In some parts of Greece, especially Crete, Fresh Mizythra is slightly fermented, until it becomes sour in taste. The result is a creamy, spreadable cheese called ‘Xinomizythra’ or ‘Sour Mizythra’. The snowy white cheese with a flavour similar to Ricotta Salata is used by Cretans to spread on paximadia or prepare tyropitas and kaltsounakia cheese pies. Aged Mizythra with rock-hard texture and salty taste is called Dried Mizythra. In this form, Mizythra is usually savoured as a grating or cooking cheese over spaghetti."

Granted AOC status in 1969, Neufchatel can be industrial, farmstead or artisanal. Artisanal Neufchatel has a grainy, close textured and thick paste covered with a soft, downy, velvety bloomy rind. Matured for 8–10 weeks, the taste and texture is reminiscent of a Camembert; mushroomy, rich, nutty and slightly yeasty."

As the cheese ripens, these flavours intensify and become more robust.  When young, Noyan is not too strong and can be used to add flavour to many types of sauces. As it matures, its enhanced flavours add quite bit of zing to quiches, soups and au gratin dishes. It also pairs deliciously with crusty bread or crackers and fruits such as apple or grapes."

These monks continued to make the cheese until the dissolution of their monasteries in 1540. Traditionally, sheep’s milk was used, but over the time cow’s milk was also used. The art of making the cheese was passed by the monks to the farmer’s wives who produced a blue variety of Wensleydale at their farmhouses. Today, Wensleydale is produced mainly from pasteurised cow’s milk with sheep’s milk added to enhance the flavour. Wensleydale Creamery in the town of Hawes is seeking to protect the name Yorkshire Wensleydale Cheese under PDO designation. But there are other producers of Wenslydale cheese in parts of the UK, mainly in Shropshire and Cheshire. Oak Smoked Wensleydale is naturally smoked for 18 hours using oak chips at the Wensleydale Creamery dairy to generate a subtle, smoked flavour along with a firmer and stronger texture. The cheese is a variant of Real Yorkshire Wensleydale as it maintains the same characteristics while adopting an attractive golden beech colour. Wensleydale goes well with fruit cake, apple and is a perfect accompaniment during lunchtime or tea time. It also tastes delicious with hot desserts like fruit pies and crumbles. It is the king of cheeseboard where its fresh, milky sweetness and robust flavours rule the roost. It complements fruity white wine such as Pinot Grigio."

It is a soft-white cheese of round shape with ash-gray, natural rind. Made from unpasteurised, cow's milk, this cheese is very similar to Olivet au Foin and Olivet au Poivre, but is cured for three months in wood ash from vines. The slow curing process gives the cheese a rather pungent, spicy aroma. The cheese, made in cylinders, has a gray skin from the ash and ivory-white supple and chalky dough. It has an earthy scent of the mould with a delicate taste. The best period for production of the cheese is May and June."

Traditional Oltermanni is a creamy, buttery, mild flavoured cheese that is moderately smooth, though not as soft and spreadable as goat cheese. It can be cut into wedges or slices and served with fresh fruits like pears, grapes or plums or wines such as Merlot or Pinot Grigio. However, a contemporary and spreadable form of Oltermanni has made it a cheese for sandwiches, sauces and soups.Though original Oltermanni is available in a tightly wrapped cylinder form, newer introductions come in tubs with peelable tops to make it easy to open and store. Oltermanni is a rich cheese with high-fat content. "

It received an AOC protection in 1980, which requires that the cheese be produced with the milk of only two breeds of ewes - Manech and Basco-Béarnaise. An uncooked and pressed cheese, Ossau-Iraty is semi-hard in texture with a thick, buff rind marked with rust and grey moulds. Beneath the brown and orange rind is an ivory white, supple and slightly grainy interior that has a creamy and buttery mouth feel. Flavours are herbaceous, nutty and fruity if the produce is from winter while the summer cheeses tend to reveal aromas of grass and flowers. Matured for at least 6 months, Ossau-Iraty often comes in a flat cylindrical shape. There are three main sizes available, small (Petit-Ossau-Iraty-Brebis Pyrenes), intermediate (non-fermier) and large (fermier). It is sometimes dusted with paprika leaves to add a kick of flavour.

The cheese comes from the regions of Basilicata and Apulia in southeast Italy and dates back to the days when the livestock was migrated from place to place. The term ‘Pallone’ comes from the word ‘palla’, the round ball-like shape of the cheese, which makes it easier to hang them in caves or transport over the backs of the donkeys during the livestock migration or the transhumance. The cheese is made in the style of pasta filata, and generally weights between 1.5 and 2.5 kg. It is shaped like a balloon, and was traditionally created in the city of Gravina, in the province of Bari. However, in the recent times the cheese is produced only in the regions of the province of Matera. The rind of the cheese is straw-coloured, smooth and hard. It becomes browner as it ages, and turns golden when the cheese gets fully matured. It needs to be aged for at least twelve months before it reaches maturity. The process of making this cheese starts with warming and curdling with rennet and then they are placed in a tompagno, which is a perforated basket. After some hours the sets are sliced up and ‘spun’ in hot water. The portions of cheese are then moulded manually, and after salting in brine for 12 to 20 hours, they are allowed to dry.  In 2009 the comune of Gravina made an application for the cheese to receive PDO status within the European Union. "

The traditional semi-soft version has a creamy, nutty taste and a velvety texture. A spicier Chilean infusion of Merken red chilli peppers, coriander seeds, and cumin flakes adds a dash of zing and heat to the flavour profile. There is also another flavour featuring fresh chives that is peppier than the traditional version.Panquehue is often eaten by pairing it with crackers and wine.

Cheeses mocking Parmigiano Reggiano are called as Parmesan or Italian hard cheese by producers to avoid legal issues. Parmigiano Reggiano cheese is named after the provinces in which it is made, namely Provinces of Parma, Reggio Emilia, Modena, Bologna and Mantua. True Parmesan cheese has a hard, gritty texture and is fruity and nutty in taste. Cheeses mocking Parmesan or inferior Parmesan may have a bitter taste. Parmigiano Reggiano cheese is mostly grated over pastas, used in soups and risottos. It is also eaten on its own as a snack."

Beneath the thin rind, the pate varies from light to dark yellow depending on age. The texture alters from dry to flaky with the addition of pleasant graininess. The flavour of younger wheels reveals quite a bit of saltiness along with a distinct savoury and aromatic herbal taste. As the cheese matures, the savoury flavour and tanginess become stronger. Paški Sir tastes best when served with fresh fruits such as grapes, prosciutto, wildflower honey or olive oil. Goes well with a Croatian red (Pelješac) or medium-bodied reds."

These ewes milk cheese from central Italy and the island of Sardinia have established a very good export market outside Italy. Of these four, Pecorino Romano from Sardinia, Lazio and Tuscan Province of Grosseto is the most widely known outside Italy. The remaining three mature PDO cheeses are Pecorino Sardo from Sardinia, Pecorino Siciliano from Sicily and Pecorino Toscano from Tuscany. Pecorinos are traditional, creamery, hard, drum-shaped cheese. They come in a variety of flavours depending on the ageing period. Aged Pecorinos, referred to as 'Stagionato', are hard and crumbly in texture with buttery and nutty flavours. Young or 'Semi-Stagionato' and 'Fresco' Pecorinos feature a softer texture with mild, creamy flavours. A good Pecorino will have a smooth, hard rind of pale straw to dark brown. The rind will vary in colour, depending on the age of the cheese, and may include a protecting coating of lard or oil. Its compact interior is white to pale yellow, with irregular, small eyes. These classic Italian Pecorinos are available in many flavours, including Pecorino Pepato spiced with black peppercorns or red chilli. Pecorino is a preferred cheese in many kinds of pasta and an obvious choice in Italian regions where the cheese is produced. Also, it served as a good substitute for the expensive Parmigiano-Reggiano."

The six main Pecorino kinds of cheese have received Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) status under European Union law. All these varieties differ from each other, depending on their ageing period. As per legislation, production of Pecorino Romano is allowed only on the islands of Sardinia, Lazio and in the Tuscan Province of Grosseto. Pecorino Sardo (from Sardinia) and Pecorino Toscano (from Tuscany) are not that salty.  As the name suggests, the history of Pecorino Romano dates back to Roman times when it was a part of the staple diet of soldiers at war. Roman authors, including Varro, Pliny the Elder, Hippocrates and Columella, have mentioned cheese & its production techniques. Even today, cheese is made using the traditional method. The wheels get salted numerous times by hand to deliver a fabulous taste. After ageing for more than five months,  it develops a dry and granular texture and a strong taste. When young, the cheese has a soft and rubbery texture with a sweet and aromatic flavour. The flavour becomes sharper and smokier when aged for more than eight months. Pecorino Romano is one of the most widely used, sharper alternatives to Parmesan cheese. Pecorino Romano is an excellent grating cheese over pasta dishes, bread and baking casseroles. Pair it with a big, bold Italian red wine or a light beer. Romano cheese is a milder cheese made from cow's milk in the United States."

        "decription": "Usually, because of its name, people wrongly attribute Petit-Suisse to Switzerland. In fact, it is a French cheese, first made in Normandy in 1850 in a dairy of Auvilliers near Beauvais. It was the idea of a Swiss employee at the dairy who suggested that adding cream to the curd would enrich the flavour of the cheese. Petit-Suisse is a fresh cheese which is unripened, unsalty, smooth and creamy. Its texture is more comparable to a thick yoghurt than a cheese. Made from cow’s milk, it is enriched with cream so that it contains at least 40% fat content. The 30g version of the cheese is called Petit-Suisse, while larger packagings are referred to as a double Suisse, double petit-Suisse or Suisse double. Petit-Suisse has a mixture of sweet and sour flavours and tastes delicious with jam, fruit, honey and nuts. It is sometimes salted and peppered with herbs. This cheese is also used as a base for several traditional French desserts."

Today, this cheese is produced across factories in Sweden from pasteurised cow's milk. It has a rich and strong flavour, which ideally goes well with a snack or a soup.Sometimes, Prästost is soaked or cured in whiskey or similar spirits to produce a variant called Saaland Pfarr. A variant of Prästost cheese cured in Absolut vodka for more than a year produces an amazing, award-winning VODCheese. "

Natalio Alba is said to have invented this cheese after he sensed Italian-Argentinean food habits which required a cheese accompaniment with a roast. The cheese was first made in 1940 with great efforts as it called for a produce that should not melt while grilling yet the inside should be melted a little. However, it was trademarked in 1963. It is a South American tradition to eat a small disc of Provoleta with asado before having the grilled meat. But given that it is so tasty, it could work as a beautiful starter with any al fresco meal. It tends to keep its shape and develops a nice smokey flavour when grilled. The cheese is seasoned with a popular mix of spices and herb oil called Chimichurri and is generally served with toasted or crusty bread. It is best had with a Argentinean wine such as Malbec."

Provolone cheese is also classified into two forms: Provolone Dolce, aged 2-3 months, has a pale yellow to white colour and sweet taste. The other, Provolone Piccante, is aged for more than four months and has a sharper taste. In South America, a similar cheese called Provoleta is eaten with grilled meat. In America, Provolone produced is similar to the Dolce variety. The flavours of Provolone broadly vary depending on where it’s made. Mostly, it’s semi-hard in texture and made from cow’s milk. Provolone contains high amounts of calcium and protein, but on the other hand, it is also high in sodium. The cheese goes along with full-bodied and aged red wines. At the table, it could be served with hot chutney, homemade bread and flatbread."

Provolone del Monaco is a semi-hard, kneaded-curd, matured cheese produced from the raw milk of cows reared within the province of Naples. For the product to maintain the consistent quality, it follows specific procedures and criteria. Twenty percent of the milk comes from Agerolese cows to give Provolone del Monaco its unique flavour. The cheese should be matured for a minimum of 180 days; at the end, the product should weigh 2.5 kg but not more than 8 kg. The pear-shaped body of the Provolone tied with raffia is cream coloured, elastic, compact and has characteristic eye holes which may increase towards the centre of the cheese. It has a high-fat content of 40.5%. Thanks to the stringent guidelines and intricate processing, the cheese turns out to be extremely flavourful, with a sweet, buttery aroma with a light, pleasantly spicy taste. With an extended maturation period, the taste and aroma of the cheese become more robust and spicier. The ripe flavour of the cheese goes along with full-bodied and aged red wines. It could be served with hot chutneys, homemade bread, and flat-bread at the table."

Provolone ValPadana, a DOP protected cheese variant, is made from the whole milk of cows grazing in the plains from Milan to Udine. Animal rennet is used to produce Provolone ValPadana, which is then moulded into various traditional shapes and matured depending on the weight of the cheese. The cheese has a sweet, delicate flavour that becomes spicier and more pronounced throughout curing. There are two types of Provolone available. Provolone Dolce is aged 2-3 months and has a pale yellow to white colour with a sweet taste. The other, Provolone Piccante, is aged for more than four months and has a sharper taste. Either version may be smoked, specified as 'Affumicata'. Provolone Dolce goes well with young and fruity wines such as Novello, Barbera and Valcalepio. Provolone Piccante makes a good pairing with aged and structured wines, like Amarone, Valpolicella, Refosco, and Barbaresco. It can be eaten as is or together with Cremona mustard or honey, or breaded and fried or grilled."

Its texture is similar to that of cream cheese, pot cheese or ricotta, with a fat content ranging from low to medium. Quark is usually sold in plastic tubs with most or all of the whey. The flavour is reminiscent of sour cream with the seasonings of herbs, spices or fruits. The quark makes a great base for many recipes, such as cheesecake, pasta, creamy sauces, sandwiches, salads and desserts. It pairs well with Champagne, White sparkling, Pacherenc-du-vic-bilh White, Coteaux-du-layon White, Monbazillac White and Cadillac White.

It is soft, white, chalky with a crumbly, slightly lumpy texture that softens as the cheese ripens. The colour of the pate is white to pale straw, which changes upon ripening. The thin and soft rind is pinkish white when young, turns to reddish grey-green after maturation. Quartirolo Lombardo is ripened between 5 to 30 days for soft PDO Quartirolo Lombardo and more than 30 days for Ripe PDO Quartirolo Lombardo. The taste is distinctive, slightly sour and aromatic in the fresh cheeses, which intensifies as the cheese ages. The delicate and fragrant flavour of the younger cheese becomes stronger and typically aromatic upon ripening.Quartirolo Lombardo is a typical table cheese that goes well with salads, cold dishes, fruits, walnuts and honey.

The cheese is \"fermier\" as it occurs on the farm where goats are reared. The interior paste has a light, soft fudge-like texture, and decorated with wild mulberry leaves. After two weeks of maturation, the cheese can be eaten although when left to mature, its moisture evaporates resulting in a firmer, drier texture with a light white and yellow rind. The cheese tastes a bit citrusy and fresh with definite herbal and floral notes. It has a clean finishing without any specific flavours of mulberry leaves mostly used for decoration. When paired with wines like Cotes de Roussillon, it's a great cheese for non-vegetarians."

Because it is not ripened, Queso Blanco is also known as Queso Fresco or fresh cheese. Due to its short maturation process, the cheese is extremely simple to make at home. The procedure for making the cheese is similar to Indian paneer, which includes boiling whole fresh milk, adding an acidifying agent to form the curds and then draining the curds in a cheesecloth. The texture and flavour of Queso Blanco is mild, firm and crumbly. It softens without melting, a characteristic very important in Latin American cooking. One can crumble Queso Blanco on salads, over rice and beans or serve it as a table cheese with fresh fruit, marmalade or chutney."

A hard cheese from the pasta filata family, Ragusano is made with whole milk from the Modicana breed of cows fed on fresh grass or hay. When milk from other cow breeds is used, due to the scarcity of the Modicana breed, the cheese is called “Cosacavaddu Rausanu”. The cheese is sold at different stages of ageing in rectangular blocks. When it is fresh within two months of production, the cheese tastes sweet, pleasant and delicate. Cheeses ripened beyond six months tend to become more flavourful and spicier. The rind is smooth and thin and exhibits a yellowish-golden colour that deepens as the cheese ages. Ragusano, smoked using natural processes, is also available, and here, the designation stamp will have the word “affumicato” attached to the name of the cheese.

        "decription": "Reblochon AOC is a semi-soft, washed-rind and smear-ripened mountain cheese that originated at the heart of the massif des Aravis, in the Thônes region of Haute-Savoie in France. The cheese was decreed as an AOC cheese in 1958 and therefore is subject to follow strict rules and regulations. It is a lightly pressed, uncooked cheese made from full-cream unpasteurised milk. Thirteenth-century fables tell of Savoie herdsmen who carried out an incomplete milking of the cows to reduce their 'taxable' production of milk. After the rent was paid to the landowners, they went back to 'remilk' (reblocher) the cows. The second milking of cows yielded milk that was rich in fat, and was used to make Reblochon. Reblochon features a fine, velvety rind, varying from yellow to orange. The close textured pate is very smooth, supple and ivory in colour. Farmhouse cheese discs are matured for at least two weeks, during which the cheese develops an edible light beige crust and buttery dough. Reblochon has a slight scent of the cellar and a mild fruity taste with an intense nutty aftertaste. Its delicate and subtle flavours go well with a glass of Savoie wine. The cheese is excellent on the cheeseboard. Reblochon also features as a classic ingredient in one of the Alps' best-loved dishes, the Tartiflette."

        "decription": "Red Leicester, formerly known as Leicester or Leicestershire cheese is a traditional hard English cheese made from unpasteurised cow’s milk. The history of cheese dates back to the 17th century when farmers recognized the need to make and look at their cheeses apart from cheese made in other parts of the country. They decided that the colour of the cheese should denote its richness and creaminess. To set it apart from cheddar and highlight the quality of cheese, Leicester is coloured with a vegetable dye called annatto. The rind is reddish-orange with a powdery mould on it. The colour indicates that the milk used has a high cream content. Today, only a couple of farms in Leicestershire make the cheese using the traditional method and raw milk. Red Leicester is a hard cheese, similar to cheddar but much moister, crumblier with a milder flavour. It matures faster than cheddar and can be sold as young as two months. A good Leicester cheese can be identified by a firm body and a close, flaky texture. Though the cheese can be consumed young, to reach its optimum flavour, it should be allowed to mature for six to nine months. A good cheese tastes slightly sweet with an almost caramel flavour and builds up a more robust taste as it ages. The cheese suits a full-bodied white wine such as Muscadet, SancerreChenin Blanc and Vouvray."

In fact, the ageing of Reypenaer is the highlight of the cheese which takes place in a 100-year-old warehouse along the Oude Rijn river in controlled conditions. There are three different varieties of Reypenaer segregated according to its age. Reypenaer XO reserve is the king of the Reypenaer cheeses. It is matured for 3 years in special cells that were built back in 1906. Reypenaer XO reserve is a limited edition cheese made using only the finest ingredients such as the milk of cows allowed to roam outside in the Dutch summers. The mild summer temperatures combined with the high level of humidity of the cellars produce a cheese that has a uniquely rich, pure flavour. It develops protein crystallisations and white spots throughout the pate which lends it its distinctive taste and aromas."

The cheese shares an interesting invention story which had the fromagerie in two minds over the extra goat milk they received to make its soft cheese Chevrochon. So Kaiser decided to use the additional goat milk to make a firmer cheese that would have a longer shelf life and a good ageing possibility. Thus was born Tomme du Haut-Richelieu, a firm cheese which has a pale orange, smooth washed rind covered in a thin, white mould. Inside the paste turns a soft beige at the wheel edge, lightening as it centres towards the middle. The aroma is hay like with a nutty and milky flavour. It has a typical yet subtle goaty tang and a melt-in-the-mouth taste that intensifies as the cheese ages. "

In the 1930s, the farmers had to dilute goat's milk with cow's to produce the cheese due to the scarcity of goatherds. But, today, they produce this rare cheese from goat's milk. Rigotte can be eaten fresh, but the actual flavours develop on maturity. The pate becomes slightly moist, and the rind becomes nearly dry and finely wrinkled after maturation. The nutty, delicate flavour of honey and acacia will leave a wonderful taste in the mouth. It goes with Condrieu, red wines like Cornas and maybe a white St. Joseph."

Determined by the type of milk used, name of Romano cheeses may be preceded by the word Vaccino (cow’s milk), Pecorino (sheep’s milk) or Caprino (goat’s milk). The most famous example of Romano cheese is Pecorino Romano, an exclusive Italian cheese with DOP designation from the Italian government.   One of the most popular Italian cheeses, Romano cheese is made from pasteurised or unpasteurised milk using animal, plant, or microbial rennet. It has a grainy texture, a hard and brittle rind and grates easily. The curing of Romano takes not less than 5 months and longer if it is planned for grating. Every Romano cheese has its own peculiarities and shows different shades in texture, flavour and cooking uses. While Pecorino Romano, made from sheep’s milk, is sharp and quite tangy the second type of Romano cheese, Caprino Romano made from goat’s milk has an extremely sharp taste. The third variety made from cow’s milk, Vacchino Romano, is very mild in flavour. Romano cheese works excellent as a table cheese. It can be grated over pasta, soups and salad or shaved onto cooked dishes and cream sauces. Hard cheeses like Romano best pair with fruity wines like Riesling and Prosecco.  "

Saint-André topped with Caramel Pecan, Craisin-Currant-Walnut, or Roasted Tomato Pine Nut forms an ideal course for Valentine's Day!

The French call this cheese a Caille doux.Affinage for the cheese takes around 2-6 weeks during which it develops a bloomy rind and a natural golden-beige colour. The taste, rind and texture are creamy, delicate and soft due to the use of soft curd in the cheesemaking process. In fact, the cheese is sometimes sold in a small ceramic or terra cotta pot since the pate can almost become runny. The optimal flavour of this creamy, buttery and nutty cheese occurs between April and September. Cheese aficionados adore Saint Félicien with a chilled Sancerre or Pouilly Fume. It is also served with Cotes du Rhone and all kinds of light red, fruity red, dry light white wines."

This makes it one of the oldest protected cheeses in the world.The cheese is produced from skimmed cow’s milk with blue fenugreek, a type of clover that gives the cheese a pale lime colour. At the last stage of production, Schabziger is moulded into distinctive conical shapes and then wrapped in silver foil, ready to be sold.Texturally, the cheese is dry, hard and aged, while flavour wise it is pungent, spicy and delicious. If a milder taste is required, the cheese is mixed with butter to make a spread called Zigerbutter. The cheese is used in cooking as a condiment or as a dipping, similar to the Dukkah.

It takes a long time to mature the cheese, a minimum of 18 months before it can be savoured. The longer the cheese is matured, the more aromatic and spicy it tastes. It can be eaten in three different ways, depending on the cheese age. At 18 months, Sbrinz can be sliced or shaved into rolls. At 24 months or even longer, Sbrinz develops full flavour and is served as an aperitif or broken up into pieces ('Möckli') on a cheeseboard. Last but not least, grated Sbrinz with its spicy aroma is perfect for adding a finishing touch to many pastas, risotto or au gratin dishes. This versatile cheese is often used instead of Parmesan cheese in Swiss cuisine."

        "decription": "Scamorza is an Italian, spun-paste cow’s milk cheese belonging to the pasta filata family. Shaped similar to provolone in a pear shape, it is a semi-soft white cheese with a texture comparable to that of a firm, dry Mozzarella. Scamorza is made in Italian regions like Apulia, Campania, Molise and in the USA. At the end of the cheese-making process, the cheese is hung together in strings to ripen for about two weeks. The process of ripening the cheese has given its name: Scamorza, which means 'beheaded' in southern Italy. After two weeks of ripening, the cheese is sold as it is or smoked. The smoked variant, called Scamorzi Affumicate (Smoked Scamorza) is made by smoking the cheese over flaming straw for around 10 to 15 minutes. A fresh version of Scamorza is also sold within a few days of production. The texture of Scamorza is elastic and stringy with piquant, milky and creamy flavours. Smoked Scamorza has a subtle, smoky flavour with a sweet, light caramel note. Scamorza is used as a substitute for Mozzarella as it imparts more interest in the recipe. Since Scamorza has excellent melting qualities, it is best known to flavour baking dishes for griddling or topped with prosciutto for extra zest. The smoky flavour of Scamorza pairs well with oak-aged Chardonnay, Pinot Girgio or Orvieto."

The cheese is popular in coastal and mountainous areas, especially around Tartous and Homs and the adjoining northern Lebanese region of Akkar.Making Shanklish is a very complex process, which requires the separation of butter from yoghurt. The skimmed yoghurt called Shenineh is curdled to form Arisheh, a delicate, crumbly white cheese. The cheese is then rolled into tennis size balls and dried in the sun for a week. It is then placed in airtight jars and left to mature in the dark. As they age, the cheese develops a layer on the surface. Later, the Shanklish balls are rinsed to remove the mould and coated in dried zaatar or thyme. For making spicy Shanklish, spices such as aniseed and chilli are mixed in before the cheese is rolled into balls.Fresh Shanklish has a soft texture with a mild taste, while those dried and aged for a longer period are pungent in odour. Cheese found around Tartus and Akkar is more delicious. Shanklish is eaten with finely-chopped onion, tomato, and olive oil. The cheese can also be crumbled and mixed with eggs or pita for a breakfast."

The rind protects the cheese but itself doesn’t have any effect on the flavour of the underlying cheese. Original Monterey Jack is the most popular variety of Jack cheese, but the same creaminess and texture can be found in Jacks flavoured with jalapeños, rosemary, habañero chillies and garlic. Dry Jack adds another dimension to a dazzling variety of mouthwatering Sonoma Jack cheeses. It is sold at different ages from ten months up to four years. The texture is firm, dry and becomes increasingly brittle with age. The flavours of Jack cheese may range from mild and mellow to high moisture Jacks to spicy, delicate and buttery in peppered versions. Dry Jack tends to produce a distinctly sweet, mushroom and earthy flavour. Jack cheeses pair excellently with Pinot Noir, Rose, Shiraz, Zinfandel or Riesling."

Milk of rare Gloucester cattle is used to produce the cheese though sometimes their milk is mixed with the milk of Friesian cattle. Made with vegetarian rennet, this cheese is also suitable for vegetarians. The rind is washed in perry, an alcoholic drink made with the local variety of Stinking Bishop pear, which gives the cheese its name. The alcoholic wash gives the cheese a distinctive pungent aroma and brown/pink rind colour. As a result of the natural rind, changeable hues of mould spots appear on the cheese from time to time. This unique cheese dates its history to the Cistercian order of monks. Stinking Bishop is also matured in humid cave-like conditions to keep up with the tradition of monastic cheese. The colour of the cheese paste varies from white-yellow to beige, with an orange to a grey rind. It is available in 5lbs wheels, measuring 8-inches in diameter and 2-inches deep. The affinage takes from six to eight weeks. Stinking Bishop is produced in very limited quantities, but its stinky smell has made it popular in the United Kingdom and abroad."

Over the years, due to the change in rennet and ways of salting, the cheese has developed its texture from crumbly to one that is rich, full and creamy.The cheese is evocative of a milder version of Stilton, with a spicy taste but many blue veins. Since the milk is rich in butterfat and protein, it gives the cheese a rich, creamy texture and a luscious, mellow yet aromatic taste/aroma. Strathdon Blue is created using vegetarian rennet, meaning the cheese is suitable for vegetarians. This celebrated cheese has won many international awards including Super gold at the 2014 World Cheese Awards. It has been judged as one of the world's 62 best cheeses."

Produced with cow's pasteurised milk, this creamy and moist cheese with a light open texture and the slightly acidic taste is suitable for vegetarians. It can be enjoyed throughout the year since cows milk never goes out of stock. Swaledale tastes the best if eaten when it is between 4 and 6 weeks old.

Some cheeses have holes known as 'eyes' while some do not. Swiss cheese without eyes is known as 'blind'. But in general, the larger the eyes in Swiss cheese, the more pronounced its flavour! The process of Swiss cheese making is designed in a way that no rind forms on the cheese. It can be eaten with fruits such as apples, pears, grapes and thinly-sliced prosciutto ham and salami. Fruity white wine, aged red wine, cran-raspberry juice, tomato or vegetable juices also prove to be great pairs for Swiss cheese."

To prevent the cheese from mould infestation, it is washed with seawater once a week. The maturation takes 6 to 10 weeks to form a thin crust. These days the cheese is made from pasteurised and unpasteurised milk in factories. These factory-made cheeses have brighter and moderate flavours. Taleggio has been granted a PDO designation and contains 48% fat. The cheese has a strong smell, but the taste is relatively mild, with an unusual fruity tang. Taleggio can be served grated on salads. Since it melts well, it can be used in risotto or polenta."

Produced by the Caws Teifi Cheese Company, this semi-hard cheese was created by John and Patrice Savage-Ontswedder.The cheese is similar to Gouda, with a deep sunshine-yellow interior. There are several varieties of Teifi, depending on the maturation period. When young, the cheese has a mellow, slightly sweet flavour and a smooth, creamy texture. As it matures, it develops deep, rich flavours with a hard and almost flaky texture, similar to Parmesan. The affinage usually takes two to nine months. Sometimes nettles, seaweeds, garlic, onion, sweet pepper and cumins are added for a distinct flavour. Available variants of Teifi cheese are: Natural Teifi Cheese, Seaweed Teifi Cheese, Onion and Garlic Teifi Cheese, Nettle Teifi Cheese, Cumin Teifi Cheese, Sweet Pepper Teifi Cheese, Oak Smoked Teifi Cheese, Mature Teifi Cheese and Chilli Teifi Cheese. The cheese melts in strings and therefore tastes excellent when heated, toasted and added as a flavouring on pizzas."

And hence the cheese takes the name 'Tete de Moine', meaning 'Monk's Head'. It is aged for a minimum of 2½ months on a small spruce plank and is typically paired with a dry, white wine. The reddish-brown crust of the cheese is grainy, moist and lubricated and the yellow-to-ivory-coloured paste is homogeneous, sticky and supple.  To enjoy the best taste, a tool called 'Girolle' was invented in 1982. A scraper attached to the central axis of the apparatus makes scrapping the cheese easier! Tete de Moine proves to be the best companion for Crisp White Wines such as Pinot Grigio."

It is produced primarily in the Aosta Valleys and Piedmont regions of Northern Italy. This soft or semi-hard cheese is made from Italian cow's milk and has excellent melting qualities. Closely related to the French tome, Toma comes in various types. The type is usually named after the region and the place it is made. Toma Piemontese variety, which has PDO status (Protected Designation of Origin) under the EU, comes from Piedmont legislation, while Toma di Gressoney, recognized as 'Prodotto AgroalimentareTradizionale', comes from Gressoney Valley. The cheese tastes best when grilled and served with burgers, sauces and casseroles. It also goes well with peaches, honey, fruit compotes, fig jam, toasted nuts, balsamic syrup, and sautéed greens."

In the first case, the pate is straw yellow with evenly distributed “eyes”, sweet, pleasant flavour and a delicate fragrance. The rind is elastic and smooth and appears deep straw-yellow to reddish brown based on the seasoning. If the cheese has been made from skimmed milk, it has a wrinkly and not elastic rind, straw white pate and tiny eyes and an intense flavour that varies with seasoning. Whole fat Toma goes well with Italian dishes such as frittata, gnocchi, and risotto and pasta fillings. Whereas, semi-fat Toma tastes best with bread, jam, honey, nuts and baked with potatoes, quiches and fondue. Strong red wines such as Dolcetto, Carema and Barolo go well with aged Tomas while light white wines make a better pairing with young Tomas."

In 1961, the abbey sold the brand \"La Providence” to the Valco society in Valognes. Trappiste de Bricquebec is a pasteurised cow's milk cheese with a smooth, glossy rind of a greyish-yellow colour. It gives off a strong smell of the cellars where it is matured at least for 6 weeks and shaped into a flat disc. The texture of the cheese is supple, smooth and dense with a nutty, mild flavour with a spicy finish. It has a fat content of around 28%. The buttery taste of the cheese goes well with bread, fruits and nuts. It tastes delicious with Muscadet, St. Emilion or any light red or dry light white wine."

This cheese is also made in other parts of Switzerland including the Jura Mountains on the border of France. The milk for the cheese is sourced from Fribourgeois breed of cows that graze on the Alpine grass and wildflowers all the way through the late spring and summer. As early fall arrives, the cows are brought down to graze on grass and summer hay. No other fodder is given to the cows except the Alpine meadows. This traditional cheese making process ensures that Vacherin Fribourgeois has a pleasant nutty flavour underpinned by notes of fresh hay and milk. Vacherin has an unpalatable natural and brushed washed rind with a stinky aroma, but it does not overpower the lovely smell of the cheese. The interior of the cheese is straw coloured with an open and buttery texture. Today Vacherin Fribourgeois is produced only by a small number of artisanal cheese makers and hence is very difficult to find. It has a Swiss AOC status with 6 varieties available: Classic (aged 6-12 weeks), Extra (aged minimum 12 weeks), Rustic (aged minimum 12 weeks, but up to 25 weeks (6 months)), Alpage (aged 12–25 weeks), Mountain (aged 9–25 weeks) and Organic (aged minimum 9 weeks). Vacherin Fribourgeois is used in fondues, cooking and as a table cheese. It is a great melting cheese, so try it on grilled sandwiches, potatoes or over steamed vegetables. Big and bold Burgundy’s, Bordeaux or reds from the Rhone Valley in France will complement the cheese well."

It is produced only by the Norrmejerier Swedish dairy company at their Burträsk farm. The Swedes salute it as the “Emperor of cheeses”. Västerbottensost is a hard, granular cheese with a distinct character and powerful aromatic aroma. The taste is similar to Parmesan cheese, salty but with sweeter notes. Also, the texture is crumblier than an Italian Parmigianino Reggiano. It is a slow-maturing cheese with a minimum of a one-year ripening period. Light yellow in colour, Västerbottensost is a full-fat cheese containing 31% fat. Since the production is limited, it is twice as expensive as other aged cheeses. It is usually produced in the shape of a wheel, with smooth, yellow waxed rind. Swedish enjoy this cheese at August crayfish parties, and it is a must ingredient in the highly popular Västerbotten cheese pie."

This Corsican cheese is matured for 1-2 weeks before dipping in brine and left to mature in a moist cheese cellar. The rind of the cheese is red-orange, while the inside reveals a soft ivory pate. A 1-2 days matured cheese can sometimes be used for cooking, but essentially, 2-3 months matured Venaco makes a perfect addition to a cheese platter. An intensely mature Venaco can be used as a grating cheese on pasta and soups. The aroma of Venaco is complex, complemented by a strong, melt-in-the-mouth taste. In early May, a great place to try Corsican cheeses is at the Venaco cheese fair, A Fiera di U Casgiu. "

When it is young, the chevre is thin-skinned, white, and slightly wrinkled, but as it starts to ripen, the Geotrichum and Candidum rind becomes more wrinkled allowing the ash to shine through. The pate becomes denser and finally, at three to five weeks, the cheese is drier and crumbly. Though, it can be enjoyed in all its stages. Wabash Cannonball is a dense sphere with a gentle, creamy, slightly acidic flavour with clean citrusy hints. The rind is a fluffy mushroomy snowball-like covering of Penicillium Candidum mould which gives way to a deeply wrinkled surface of Geotrichum Candidum as it matures. At its optimum age, the cheese is musky, slightly sweet with a more delicate flavour. Cannonball is best on a cheeseboard, served with dry white wines such as Sauvignon Blanc or Gruner Veltliner. It has been Best-of-Show, American Cheese Society 1995."

With access to technology from England in the 1850s, Australia made more than 160 cheeses. Washed rind cheeses are originally from the alleys of northern France, made famous by the monks who invented them. It was a deliberate attempt to develop a meaty flavour in the cheese as people have to abstain from meat for a long period. Washed rind cheeses are periodically washed in a solution of saltwater brine, wines and/or mould-bearing agents so that their surface becomes responsive to bacteria. This bacterium (Brevibacterium Linens) “smears” the cheese with a firm, palatable, bright red/orange rind and imparts pungent odours and distinctive flavours to the product. Also known as surface-ripened, the cheeses can be soft, semi-hard, or hard. Some common examples are Titlist, Gruyere and Raclette, and their rinds are washed during the maturation process to develop a crusty shell. These rich cheeses have a robust aroma with a sweet, earthy and little nutty flavour."

These monks continued to make the cheese until the dissolution of their monasteries in 1540. Traditionally the cheese was made using sheep's milk. The art of making the cheese was passed by the monks to the farmer's wives who produced a blue variety of Wensleydale at their farmhouses. Today, Wensleydale is produced mainly from pasteurised cow's milk and sheep's milk to enhance the flavour. Wensleydale Creamery in the town of Hawes is seeking to protect the name Yorkshire Wensleydale Cheese under PDO designation. But there are other producers of Wensleydale cheese in parts of the UK, mainly in Shropshire and Cheshire. Wensleydale Creamery produces five types of Wensleydale cheese depending on the age and flavours - Real Yorkshire Wensleydale, Mature Wensleydale, Extra Mature Wensleydale, Blue Wensleydale and Oak Smoked Wensleydale. A Real Yorkshire Wensleydale is creamy-white in colour has a supple, crumbly, moist and flaky texture. It appears similar to a young Caerphilly. The flavour is mild, clean, and slightly sweet with hints of wild honey savour and fresh acidity. As it ages the cheese develops a fuller, deeper flavour as well becomes firmer. Yorkshire Wensleydale cheese produced by Wensleydale Creamery is available in truckles/cylinders or block shaped in varying shapes and sizes up to 25kg. Wensleydale goes well with fruit cake, apple and is a perfect accompaniment during lunchtime or tea time. It also tastes delicious with hot desserts like fruit pies and crumbles. It is the king of cheeseboard where its fresh, milky sweetness and robust flavours rule the roost. Varieties: Oak Smoked Wensleydale is produced by naturally smoking the cheese for 18 hours using oak chips, to create a subtle, smoked flavour. It is the same as Real Yorkshire Wensleydale except for the striking golden beech colour and the robust flavour imparted by the smokiness. Mature Wensleydale is a harder, flavoured variant of Wensleydale. Extra Mature Wensleydale is the strongest Wensleydale aged for nine months. Blue Wensleydale is a blue-veined cheese that has been the supreme champion winner at the British Cheese Awards 2012. Unpasteurized Wensleydale handcrafted from a single dairy herd is also available. It has a complex lemony flavour with a buttery and creamy texture. Blended Wensleydale, flavoured with delicate fruits like cranberries, apricots, pineapples, ginger, garlic and chives is one of the favourites buys at the creamery. Wensleydale cheeses complement fruity white wine such as Pinot Grigio."

With age, the flavours of Charleston intensify and become more distinctive. As the cheese is free of any preservatives, some discolouration on the outer rind is treated as a natural part of its maturation. Determine the ripeness of Charleston by feeling the softness all across the surface. The cheese has a shelf life of 7 to 8 weeks from the make date.

The extra mature version has an added complexity and strength complemented by a texture which is much harder and crumbly. The flavours are a delicate balance between sweet and salt with a long finish to the last. Prepared with vegetarian rennet, this artisan cheese pairs well with a white Malvasia from Degrassi and red Curvee from Vina Vrsaljko."
